    "The industrial core of the world economy saw its level of material productivity and standard of living explode in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Elsewhere the growth of productivity levels and standards of living and the spread of indus  trial technologies were slower. As the industrialized economies grew while indus  trial technologies spread slowly elsewhere, the world became a more and more unequal place. As development economist Lant Pritchett puts it, the dominant fea  ture of world economic history from the Industrial Revolution up until 1980 or so is “divergence, big time.” In terms of relative incomes and productivity levels, the world today is very unequal and very divergent, as Figure 5.8 shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who live in relatively poor regions of the world today have higher mate  rial living standards than did their predecessors who lived in those regions a cen  tury ago. But the relative gap vis-a-vis the industrial core has grown extraordinar  ily and extravagantly. In the first half of the nineteenth century the average inhabitant of an average country had perhaps one-half the material standard of liv  ing of a citizen of the world’s leading industrial economy. Although the difficulties of making such comparisons are overwhelming (and Box 5.3 provides some insight into the difficulties of making such comparisons), our best estimate is that the aver  age inhabitant of an average country has only one-sixth the material standard of living and productivity level of a leading nation like the United States today.\n",

    "Such divergence is not inevitable. The United States, with its perhaps 14- to 25-fold increase in output per worker over the years since 1870, has not been the fastest growing economy in the world. A number of other economies at different levels of industrialization, development, and material productivity a century ago have now con  verged, and their levels of productivity, economic structures, and standards of living today are very close to those of the United States (see Box 5.4). The six largest of these converging economies and the United States make up the so-called Group of Seven (G-7) economies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The six non-U.S. members’ steady process of convergence to the U.S. level from 1950 until about 2000 is shown in Figure 5.9 on page 142.\n",
    "Most of these economies were much poorer than the United States in 1870. Most were significantly poorer in 1950. The Japanese economy, for example, went from a level of output per capita equal to 16 percent of the U.S. level in 1950 to 84 per  cent of the U.S. level in 1992 — before falling steeply backward during Japan’s recent recession. Italian levels of GDP per capita have gone from 30 to 65 percent of the U.S. level; German levels, from 40 to 75 percent; Canadian levels, from 70 to 85 percent; and British levels, from 60 to 70 percent in the past half-century.\n",

    "Moreover, much of the remaining differential between the United States and western Europe is the result of different institutions and tastes for leisure; for exam  ple, western Europeans take what many Americans would regard as extravagant vacations. Much of today’s differential between the United States and Japan is the result of deliberate political choice: Japan’s politicians have decided to keep their agriculture-based industries and their wholesale and retail distribution systems pro  tected from competition, small scale, and thus — from an American standpoint — inefficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "When our focus is on comparing standards of living, either across time or across countries, we get much more meaningful figures by correcting current (and even average trend) exchange rates for differences in purchasing power parity (PPP). The differences between estimates of relative income levels based on current exchange rates and estimates based on PPP calculations can be very large. On a purchasing- power-parity basis GDP per worker in the United States today is some 13 times GDP per worker in India; by contrast, on an average exchange rate basis GDP per worker in the United States today is more than 70 times the level in India.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPP-based calculations attempt (as the name implies) to translate one currency into another at a rate that preserves average purchasing power. But current exchange rates do not preserve purchasing power. If you exchange your dollars in the United States for rupees in India you will find that your rupees in India will buy about the same amount of internationally traded manufactured goods as your dollars would have bought in the United States. (Unless, of course, you try to buy something that the Indian government has decided to put up a trade barrier against.) But your rupees in India will buy you vastly more in the way of personal services, the products of skilled craftspeople, and any other labor-intensive goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? International arbitrage keeps the exchange rate at the level that makes easily traded manufactured goods roughly equally expensive. If they weren’t, someone could make an easy fortune by shipping them from where they were cheap to where they were dear. But how — in this world of stringent immigration restrictions — can a cook in Bangalore take advantage of the fact that there is fierce demand in Marin County, north of San Francisco, for caterers who can prepare a good curry? Because relative productivity levels in labor services are much more equal than rel  ative productivity levels in manufacturing, living standards throughout the world are more equal than exchange rate-based calculations suggest.\n",

    "By and large the economies that have converged are those that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which was started shortly after World War II, in the days of the Marshall Plan, as a group of coun  tries that received (or gave) Marshall Plan aid to help rebuild and reconstruct after the war. Countries that received Marshall Plan aid adopted a common set of eco  nomic policies: large private sectors freed of government regulation of prices, investment with its direction determined by profit-seeking businesses, large social insurance systems to redistribute income, and governments committed to avoiding mass unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original OECD members all wound up with mixed economies. In these, mar  kets direct the flow of resources, while governments stabilize the economy, provide social insurance safety nets, and encourage entrepreneurship and enterprise. The member nations arrived at this setup largely due to good luck, partly due to the Cold War, and partly as a result of post-World War II institutional reforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration was essentially the price countries had to pay for receiving Marshall Plan aid. The U.S. executive branch was unwilling to send much aid to countries that it thought were likely to engage in destructive economic policies, largely because it did not believe that it could win funding from the Republican- dominated Congress for a Marshall Plan that did not impose such strict condi  tionality upon recipients. \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, countries that were relatively rich after World War II but did not adopt OECD-style institutional arrangements — such as Argentina and Venezuela — lost relative ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the OECD economies became richer, they completed their demographic tran  sitions: Population growth rates fell. The policy emphasis on entrepreneurship and enterprise boosted national investment rates, so the OECD economies all had healthy investment rates as well.

    "## 5.3.1 Divergence, Big Time\n",
    "\n",
    "The industrial core of the world economy saw its level of material productivity and standard of living explode in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Elsewhere the growth of productivity levels and standards of living and the spread of indus  trial technologies were slower. As the industrialized economies grew while indus  trial technologies spread slowly elsewhere, the world became a more and more unequal place. As development economist Lant Pritchett puts it, the dominant fea  ture of world economic history from the Industrial Revolution up until 1980 or so is “divergence, big time.” In terms of relative incomes and productivity levels, the world today is very unequal and very divergent, as Figure 5.8 shows.\n",
    "Those who live in relatively poor regions of the world today have higher mate  rial living standards than did their predecessors who lived in those regions a cen  tury ago. But the relative gap vis-a-vis the industrial core has grown extraordinar  ily and extravagantly. In the first half of the nineteenth century the average inhabitant of an average country had perhaps one-half the material standard of liv  ing of a citizen of the world’s leading industrial economy. Although the difficulties of making such comparisons are overwhelming (and Box 5.3 provides some insight into the difficulties of making such comparisons), our best estimate is that the aver  age inhabitant of an average country has only one-sixth the material standard of living and productivity level of a leading nation like the United States today.\n",
    "The Exception: OECD Economies\n",
    "Such divergence is not inevitable. The United States, with its perhaps 14- to 25-fold increase in output per worker over the years since 1870, has not been the fastest growing economy in the world. A number of other economies at different levels of industrialization, development, and material productivity a century ago have now con  verged, and their levels of productivity, economic structures, and standards of living today are very close to those of the United States (see Box 5.4). The six largest of these converging economies and the United States make up the so-called Group of Seven (G-7) economies. The six non-U.S. members’ steady process of convergence to the U.S. level from 1950 until about 2000 is shown in Figure 5.9 on page 142.\n",
    "Most of these economies were much poorer than the United States in 1870. Most were significantly poorer in 1950. The Japanese economy, for example, went from a level of output per capita equal to 16 percent of the U.S. level in 1950 to 84 per  cent of the U.S. level in 1992 — before falling steeply backward during Japan’s recent recession. Italian levels of GDP per capita have gone from 30 to 65 percent of the U.S. level; German levels, from 40 to 75 percent; Canadian levels, from 70 to 85 percent; and British levels, from 60 to 70 percent in the past half-century.\n",
    "Moreover, much of the remaining differential between the United States and western Europe is the result of different institutions and tastes for leisure; for exam  ple, western Europeans take what many Americans would regard as extravagant vacations. Much of today’s differential between the United States and Japan is the result of deliberate political choice: Japan’s politicians have decided to keep their agriculture-based industries and their wholesale and retail distribution systems pro  tected from competition, small scale, and thus — from an American standpoint — inefficient.\n",

    " PURCHASING-POWER-PARITY AND REAL EXCHANGE RATE COMPARISONS: SOME TOOLS\n",
    "When our focus is on comparing standards of living, either across time or across countries, we get much more meaningful figures by correcting current (and even average trend) exchange rates for differences in purchasing power parity (PPP). The differences between estimates of relative income levels based on current exchange rates and estimates based on PPP calculations can be very large. On a purchasing- power-parity basis GDP per worker in the United States today is some 13 times GDP per worker in India; by contrast, on an average exchange rate basis GDP per worker in the United States today is more than 70 times the level in India.\n",
    "PPP-based calculations attempt (as the name implies) to translate one currency into another at a rate that preserves average purchasing power. But current exchange rates do not preserve purchasing power. If you exchange your dollars in the United States for rupees in India you will find that your rupees in India will buy about the same amount of internationally traded manufactured goods as your dollars would have bought in the United States. (Unless, of course, you try to buy something that the Indian government has decided to put up a trade barrier against.) But your rupees in India will buy you vastly more in the way of personal services, the products of skilled craftspeople, and any other labor-intensive goods and services.\n",
    "Why? International arbitrage keeps the exchange rate at the level that makes eas  ily traded manufactured goods roughly equally expensive. If they weren’t, someone could make an easy fortune by shipping them from where they were cheap to where they were dear. But how — in this world of stringent immigration restrictions — can a cook in Bangalore take advantage of the fact that there is fierce demand in Marin County, north of San Francisco, for caterers who can prepare a good curry? Because relative productivity levels in labor services are much more equal than rel  ative productivity levels in manufacturing, living standards throughout the world are more equal than exchange rate-based calculations suggest.\n",
    "WHY HAVE THESE ECONOMIES CONVERGED? A POLICY\n",
    "By and large the economies that have converged are those that belong to the Orga  nization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which was started shortly after World War II, in the days of the Marshall Plan, as a group of coun  tries that received (or gave) Marshall Plan aid to help rebuild and reconstruct after the war. Countries that received Marshall Plan aid adopted a common set of eco  nomic policies: large private sectors freed of government regulation of prices, investment with its direction determined by profit-seeking businesses, large social insurance systems to redistribute income, and governments committed to avoiding mass unemployment.\n",
    "The original OECD members all wound up with mixed economies. In these, mar  kets direct the flow of resources, while governments stabilize the economy, provide social insurance safety nets, and encourage entrepreneurship and enterprise. The member nations arrived at this setup largely due to good luck, partly due to the Cold War, and partly as a result of post-World War II institutional reforms.\n",
    "This configuration was essentially the price countries had to pay for receiving Marshall Plan aid. The U.S. executive branch was unwilling to send much aid to\n",

    "countries that it thought were likely to engage in destructive economic policies, largely because it did not believe that it could win funding from the Republican- dominated Congress for a Marshall Plan that did not impose such strict condi  tionality upon recipients. By contrast, countries that were relatively rich after World War II but did not adopt OECD-style institutional arrangements — such as Argentina and Venezuela — lost relative ground.\n",
    "As the OECD economies became richer, they completed their demographic tran  sitions: Population growth rates fell. The policy emphasis on entrepreneurship and enterprise boosted national investment rates, so the OECD economies all had healthy investment rates as well. These factors boosted their equilibrium capital- output ratios.

    " THE EAST ASIAN MIRACLE: POLICY\n",
    "The story of extraordinarily successful economies goes beyond the original OECD nations. The economies of the “east Asian miracle” have over the past two gener  ations exhibited stronger growth than has ever before been seen anywhere in the world. They have not yet converged to the standards of living and levels of eco  nomic productivity found in the world economy’s industrial core, but they are con  verging.\n",
    "Immediately before World War II the regions that are now South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan had output-per-worker levels less than one-tenth the level of the United States. Today Singapore’s GDP per capita is 90 percent, Hong Kong’s is 70 percent, Taiwan’s is 50 percent, and South Korea’s is 45 per  cent of the U.S. level. A second wave of east Asian economies — Malaysia and Thailand — now average more than one-quarter of the U.S. level of GDP per capita.\n",
    "The successful east Asian economies share a number of similarities with the OECD economies in terms of economic policy and structure. Resource alloca  tion decisions are by and large left to the market. Governments regard the encouragement of entrepreneurship and enterprise as a major goal. And high saving and investment rates are encouraged by a number of different govern  ment policies.\n",
    "Yet there are also a number of differences vis-a-vis the OECD. Governments in east Asia have been more aggressive in pursuing industrial policy and somewhat less aggressive in establishing social insurance systems than have the OECD economies. However, they have also had more egalitarian income distributions and hence less need for redistribution and social insurance. They have subsidized cor  porations that they believe are strategic for economic development, thinking that their bureaucrats know better than the market — heresy to economists. (However, it is worth noting that they have focused subsidies on the companies that have proved successful at exporting goods to other countries, so their bureaucrats have in a sense been rewarding the judgment of foreign markets.) The examples of suc  cessful catching up suggest that growth could have been faster in the world econ  omy. Economies — even very poor ones — can rapidly adopt modern machine technologies and move their productivity levels close to first-world leading-edge standards.\n",
    "to have been ruled by communists in the twentieth century is a virtual guarantee of relative poverty.\n",
    "Winston Churchill once labeled a snaky geographic line across Eurasia the “Iron Curtain.” On one side were regimes that owed their allegiance to Karl Marx and to Marx’s viceroys on Earth. On the other side were regimes that claimed, in the 1946-1989 Cold War, to be of the “free world”— regimes that were, if not good, at least less bad. Walk this geographic line from Poland to Korea and then hop over to the only Western hemisphere communist satellite, Cuba, looking first at the level of material welfare in the communist countries and then at the level of material welfare in the noncommunist countries. The location of the Iron Curtain is a historical accident: It is where Stalin’s Russian armies stopped after World War II, where Mao’s Chinese armies stopped in the early 1950s, and where Giap’s Vietnamese armies stopped in the mid-1970s.\n",

    "Notice as you walk that outside the Iron Curtain, the countries are far better off in terms of GDP per capita (see Table 5.4). They are not necessarily better off in education, health care, or the degree of income inequality. If you were in the poorer half of the population, you probably received a better education and had access to better medical care in Cuba than in Mexico. But the countries fortunate enough to lie outside what was the Iron Curtain were and are vastly more pros  perous. Depending on how you count and how unlucky you are, between 40 and 94 percent of the potential material prosperity of a country was annihilated if it happened to fall under communist rule in the twentieth century. The fact that a large part of the globe was under communist rule in the twentieth century is one major reason for the world’s divergence. A failure to successfully aid postcommu  nist economies in their transition would be a further blow, and, as Box 5.6 dis  cusses, “transition” is not going well.\n",
    "The Rule: Divergence in General\n",
    "Even if attention is confined to non-communist-ruled economies, there still has been enormous divergence in relative output-per-worker levels over the past 100 years. Since 1870, the ratio of richest to poorest economies has increased sixfold. In 1870 two-thirds of all countries had GDP-per-capita levels between 60 and 160 percent of the average. Today the range that includes two-thirds of all countries extends from 35 to 280 percent of the average.\n",
    "There is reason to hope that the era of widening world income and productiv  ity gaps is over. China for the past 25 and India for the past 20 years have begun to grow much faster than before, and to begin the process of catching up to the world’s industrial leaders. Together they are home to nearly 40 percent of the human race.\n",

    " POSTCOMMUNISM: POLICY\n",
    "The demolition of the Berlin Wall and the elimination of the Iron Curtain have not significantly improved the situation in what are euphemistically and opti  mistically called “economies in transition” (from socialism to capitalism, that is). Figuring out how to move from a stagnant, ex-communist economy to a dynamic, growing one is very difficult, and no one has ever done it before.\n",
    "A few of the economies in transition appear to be on the path toward rapid con  vergence with western Europe: Slovenia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland have already successfully maneuvered through enough of the transition phase to have advanced their economies beyond the point reached before 1989. It seems clear that their economic destiny is to become, effectively, part of western Europe. Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia appear to have good prospects of follow  ing their example.\n",
    "Elsewhere, however, the news is bad. Whether reforms have taken place step-by- step or all at once, whether ex-communists have been excluded from or have dom  inated the government, and whether governments have been nationalist or interna  tionalist, the results have been similar. Output has fallen, corruption has been rife, and growth has not resumed. Material standards of living in Ukraine today are less than half of what they were when General Secretary Gorbachev ruled from Moscow.\n",
    "Economists debate ferociously the appropriate economic strategy for unwinding the inefficient centrally planned Soviet-style economy. The fact that such a transi  tion has never been undertaken before should make advice givers cautious. And one other observation should make advice givers depressed: The best predictor of whether an eastern European country’s transition will be rapid and successful or not appears to be its distance from western European political and financial capi  tals like Vienna, Frankfurt, and Stockholm.\n",
    "Sources of Divergence\n",
    "The principal cause of the extraordinary variation in output per worker between countries today is differences in their respective equilibrium capital-output ratios. Two secondary causes are, first, openness to creating and adapting the technolo  gies that enhance the efficiency of labor as measured by levels of development two generations ago and, second, the level of education today.\n",
    "Productivity two generations ago is a good indicator of the level of technolog  ical knowledge that had been acquired as of a half-century ago. The level of edu  cation today captures the country’s ability to invent and acquire further techno  logical expertise today. Without education, inventing new and adopting foreign technological knowledge are simply not possible.\n",
    "Global Patterns\n",
    "Together these factors — the determinants of capital intensity (the capital-output ratio) and the two determinants of access to technology — account for the bulk of the differences between countries in their relative productivity levels.\n",
    "The determinants of the equilibrium capital-output ratio play a very powerful role. A higher share of investment in national product is powerfully correlated with relative levels of output per worker. No country with an investment rate of less than 10 percent has an output-per-worker level even 20 percent that of the United\n",
    "\n",
    " 146 Chapter 5 The Reality of Economic Growth: History and Prospect\n",
    "States. No country with an investment share of less than 20 percent has an output- per-worker level greater than 75 percent of the U.S. level.\n",
    "A high level of labor-force growth is correlated, albeit less powerfully, with a low level of output per worker. The average country with a labor-force growth rate of more than 3 percent per year has an output-per-worker level of less than 20 per  cent of the U.S. level. The average country with a labor-force growth rate of less than 1 percent has an output-per-worker level that is greater than 60 percent of the U.S. level.\n",
    "Together these determinants of the equilibrium capital-output ratio can, statis  tically, account for up to half of the variation in national economies’ levels of pro  ductivity per worker in the world today. The power of these factors is central to the theoretical model of economic growth presented in Chapter 4 and should not be underestimated. Indeed, their power is the reason we spent so much space on the standard growth model in Chapter 4.\n",
    "But the factors stressed in Chapter 4 are not the only major determinants of rel  ative wealth and poverty in the world today. Differences in the efficiency of labor are as important as differences in equilibrium capital-output ratios. Differences in the efficiency of labor arise from the differential ability of workers to handle and utilize modern technologies. The efficiency of labor is high where education lev  els are high — so workers can use the modern technologies they are exposed to — and where economic contact with the industrial core is high — so workers and managers are exposed to the modern technologies invented in the world’s R&D laboratories.\n",
    "Schooling is the variable that has the strongest correlation with output per worker. Countries that have an average of four to six years of schooling have output- per-worker levels that average 20 percent of the U.S. level. Those with an average level of schooling of more than 10 years have output-per-worker levels of 65 per  cent of the U.S. level, as Figure 5.10 shows.\n",
    "No single best indicator exists of a country’s exposure to — and thus ability to adopt and adapt — the technologies invented in the industrial core that amplify the efficiency of labor. Some economists focus on trade and foreign investment as the main sources of increased efficiency and technological capability. Others focus on geographic and climatic factors that have influenced migration and still influ  ence trade and intellectual exchange. Still others focus on institutions of gover  nance and their effect on entrepreneurship as the key variable. But as much as economists dispute which variables are most important as determinants of tech- nology transfer and the efficiency of labor, all agree that all these variables are important indeed to understanding why our world today is the way it is.\n",
    "Cause and Effect, Effect and Cause\n",
    "All the factors discussed are both causes and effects. High population growth and low levels of output per worker go together both because rapid population growth reduces the equilibrium capital-output ratio and because poor countries have not yet undergone their demographic transitions. This interaction — in which a high rate of population growth reduces the equilibrium capital-output ratio and a low equilibrium capital-output ratio means that the demographic transition is not far advanced — creates a vicious spiral that reinforces relative poverty.\n",
    "Moreover, demography is not the only vicious spiral potentially present. A poor country must pay a high relative price for the capital equipment it needs to acquire in order to turn its saving into productive additions to its capital stock. This should\n",

    "come as no surprise. The world’s most industrialized and prosperous economies are the most industrialized and prosperous because they have attained very high levels of manufacturing productivity: Their productivity advantage in unskilled service industries is much lower than that in capital- and technology-intensive manufac  tured goods. The higher relative price of machinery in developing countries means that poor countries get less investment — a smaller share of total investment in real GDP — out of any given effort at saving some fixed share of their incomes.\n",
    "Moreover, to the extent that education is an important kind of investment, a good education is much harder to provide in a poorer country. Even primary edu  cation requires at its base a teacher, some books, and a classroom — things that are relatively cheap and easy for a rich country to provide but expensive for a poor country. In western Kenya today the average primary school classroom has 0.4 book per pupil.\n",
    "But virtuous circles are also possible. Anything that increases productivity and sets the demographic transition in motion will reduce the rate of growth of the labor force, increase the amount of investment bought by any given amount of sav  ing, and make education easier.\n",
    "How important are these vicious spirals and virtuous circles? It is hard to look at the cross-country pattern of growth over the past century without thinking that such vicious spirals and virtuous circles must have been very important. Other  wise, the massive divergence in relative productivity levels seems inexplicable.\n",

    "Always keep in mind that in the context of economic growth “stagnation” and “failure” are relative terms. Consider Argentina once again, for it has been one of the world’s most disappointing performers in terms of economic growth in the twentieth century. Argentina has experienced substantial economic growth. Offi  cially measured labor productivity or national product per capita in Argentina today is perhaps three times what it was in 1900. True productivity, taking adequate account of the value of new commodities, is higher. But the much more smoothly running engine of capitalist development in Norway — no more, and probably less, rich and productive than Argentina in 1900 — has multiplied measured national product per capita there by a factor of 9.\n",
    "A pattern of productivity growth like Argentina’s is heartbreakingly slow when compared to what, reasonably, might have been and was achieved by the world’s industrial leaders. What is bad about falling behind, or falling further behind, is not that second place is a bad place to be — it is false to think that the only thing that matters is to be top nation and that it is better to be poor but first than rich but second. What is bad about falling behind is that the world’s industrial leaders provide an easily viewable benchmark of how things might have been different and of how much better things might have been. There was no destiny keeping Buenos Aires today from looking like and having its people as rich as those of Paris, Toronto, or Sydney.\n",
    "Half Empty and Half Full\n",
    "In many respects, it is decidedly odd that the world distribution of output per worker is as unequal as it is. World trade, migration, and flows of capital should all work to move resources and consumption goods from where they are cheap to\n",
    "\n",
    " where they are dear. As they travel with increasing speed and increasing volume as transportation and communication costs fall, these commodity and factor-of- production flows should erode differences in productivity and living standards between national economies. Moreover, most of the edge in standards of living and productivity levels held by the industrial core is no one’s private property but, instead, is the common intellectual and scientific heritage of humankind. Hence every poor economy has an excellent opportunity to catch up with the rich by adopting and adapting from this open storehouse of modern machine technology.\n",
    "We can view this particular glass either as half empty or as half full. Half full is that much of the world has already made the transition to sustained economic growth. Most people today live in economies that, while far poorer than the leading- edge postindustrial nations of the world’s economic core, have successfully climbed onto the escalator of economic growth and thus the escalator to modernity. The eco  nomic transformation of most of the world is less than a century behind that of the leading-edge economies — only an eyeblink behind from the perspective of the six millennia since the spread of agriculture out of the Middle East’s fertile crescent.\n",
    "Moreover, perhaps we can look forward to a future in which convergence of rel  ative income levels will finally begin to take place. The bulk of humanity is now achieving material standards of living at which the demographic transition takes hold. As population growth rates in developing countries fall, their capital-output ratios will begin to rise quickly. With tolerable government, reasonable security of property, and better ways of achieving an education, their output-per-worker lev  els and material standards of living will converge to the world’s leading edge.\n",
    "Half empty is that we live today in the most unequal age — in terms of the diver  gence in the life prospects of children born into different economies — that the world has ever seen. One and a half billion people today live in economies that have not made the transition to intensive economic growth and have not climbed onto the escalator to modernity. It is very hard to argue that the median inhabitant of Africa is any better off in material terms than his or her counterpart of a generation ago.\n",
    "Policies for Saving, Investment, and Education\n",
    "Any government can adopt policies that boost national saving, improve the ability to translate saving into productive investment, and accelerate the demographic transition.\n",
    "Saving and Investment\n",
    "Policies that ensure savers get reasonable rates of return on their savings have the potential to boost the saving rate. By contrast, systems of economic governance in which profits are diverted into the hands of the politically powerful through restric  tions on entrepreneurship tend over time to diminish saving, as do economic poli  cies that divert the real returns to savings into the hands of financiers or the gov  ernment through inflation. Government deficits also have the potential to reduce the saving rate: Unless consumers and investors are farsighted enough to recog  nize that a government deficit now means a tax increase later, a government that spends more than it raises in revenue must borrow — and the amount borrowed is not a contribution to total national saving because it is not available to fund investment.\n",

    "decade or a generation off the time needed to industrialize — if the foreign-funded capital is used wisely. Free-trade policies that allow businesses to freely earn and spend the foreign exchange they need to purchase new generations of machinery and equipment are an effective way of boosting investment. Policies that impose heavy tariffs or require scarce import licenses in order to purchase foreign-made capital equipment are a sure sign that a country will not get its money’s worth out of a given nominal savings share but will, instead, find that real investment remains low. Indeed, many of the most successful developing states have done the oppo  site. They have provided large subsidies to fund investment and expansion by busi  nesses that have demonstrated their competence and productivity by successfully exporting and thus competing in the world market.\n",
    "Education\n",
    "Universal education, especially of girls, pays a twofold benefit. Investments are more likely to be productive with a better educated workforce to draw on; hence investments are more likely to be made. Educated women are likely to want at least as much education for their children as they had, and they are likely to have relatively attractive opportunities outside the home, so the birthrate is likely to fall.\n",
    "The developing countries of the world appear, for the most part, to be going through the demographic transition faster than the economies of today’s industrial core did in the past three centuries. Thus current estimates of the world’s popula  tion in 2050 are markedly lower than the estimates of a decade ago. Ten years ago the projected global population in 2050 was 16 billion or more; today it is 12 bil  lion or less. This is due, in part at least, to rapid expansions in educational attain  ment in today’s developing economies.\n",
    "A high level of educational attainment also raises the efficiency of labor both by teaching skills directly and by making it easier to advance the general level of tech  nological expertise. A leading-edge economy with a high level of educational attain  ment is likely to have more inventions. A follower economy with a high level of educational attainment is likely to have a more successful time at adapting to local conditions the inventions and innovations from the industrial core of the world economy. How large these effects are at the macroeconomic level is uncertain, but that they are there nobody doubts.\n",
    "The east Asian economies, especially, provide examples of how uncorrupt and well-managed developing states can follow macroeconomic policies that accelerate economic growth and convergence. These economies, which have provided incen  tives to accelerate the demographic transition and boost saving and investment, have managed to close the gap vis-a-vis the world economy’s industrial core faster than anyone would have believed possible.\n",
    "Policies for Technological Advance\n",
    "Without better technology, increases in capital stock produced by investment rap  idly run into diminishing returns. And without improvements in the “technolo  gies” of organization, government, and education, productivity stagnates.\n",
    "Somewhat surprisingly, economists have relatively little to say about what governs technological progress. Why did better technology raise living standards by 2 percent annually two generations ago but by less than 1 percent during the subsequent two decades? Why did technology progress by only 0.25 percent per year in the early 1800s? Improving literacy, communications, and research and\n",
    "\n",
    " development may help explain faster progress since the Industrial Revolution than before it and faster progress in the twentieth than in the nineteenth century. Yet, as noted above, as important a feature of recent economic history as the 1973-1995 productivity growth slowdown remains largely a mystery.\n",
    "Invention and Innovation\n",
    "Economists note that technological progress has two components: science (solid- state physics and the invention of the transistor, the mapping of the human genome, the discovery that potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal when mixed together and exposed to heat have interesting properties) and research and development that lead to successful innovation. About pure science economists have almost nothing to say. About research and development, and the innovations it generates, economists have rather more to say.\n",
    "Economists note that perhaps 75 percent of all U.S. scientists and engineers work on research and development for private firms. R&D spending amounts to about 3 percent of GDP in the United States and other advanced industrial economies. One-fifth of total gross investment is research and development. More than half of net investment is research and development — investments in knowl  edge, as opposed to investments in machinery, equipment, structures, and infra  structure.\n",
    "Businesses conduct investments in R&D to increase their profits. Firms spend money on R&D for reasons analogous to those that lead them to expand their capac  ity or improve their factories. If the expected present value of profits from an R&D project at the prevailing rate is greater than the costs of the project, then the busi  ness will spend money on the project. If not, then it will not.\n",
    "Rivalry and Excludability\n",
    "But some features of technology make thinking about the R&D process more complicated than thinking about other types of investment. First and most important, research and development is a public good. A firm that has discovered something — a new and more profitable process, a new and better way of organ  izing the factory, a new type of commodity that can be produced — will not reap the entire social benefit from its discovery. Other businesses can examine the innovation — the product, the process, the method of organization — and copy it. They can probably do so for a much lower cost than was needed to research and develop the innovation in the first place.\n",
    "By contrast, a firm that has just spent a large sum to buy and move into a new building does not have to worry that any other firm will use that building as well. As a commodity, a building — or a machine, or even the skills and experience inside a worker’s head — is both rival and excludable. To say that a commodity is rival means that if one firm is using it, another firm cannot do so: I cannot use that hammer to pound this nail if you are now using it to pound that other nail. To say that a commodity is excludable means that the uowner” of the commodity can easily monitor who is using it and can easily keep those whom he or she does not authorize from using it.\n",
    "Most physical commodities are (or, with the assistance of the legal system, can easily be made) both rival and excludable. But by their nature ideas are not. Ideas are definitely not rival — nothing in the physical universe makes it impossible for me to use the same idea you are using. And ideas are hard to make excludable as well: How can you keep me from thinking what I want to think?\n",

    "patent laws and copyrights\n",
    "Laws designed to encourage invention and innovation\n",
    "by providing the right to exclude anyone else from using a discovery (patent)\n",
    "or intellectual property (copyright) for a period of years.\n",
    "Patents and Copyrights\n",
    "To protect ideas and intellectual property in general, countries have patent laws and copyrights. In fact, one of the few enumerated powers that the U.S. Consti  tution gives Congress is the power to set up limited-term patent and copyright laws. Patents give a firm that has discovered something new the right to exclude anyone else from using that discovery for a period of years. But even the strictest patent and copyright laws are incomplete. Often the most valuable part of the R&D process is figuring out not how to do something but whether it (or something very close to it) can be done at all. Once a patent has been granted, other firms can and do search for alternative ways of making it or ways of making something close to it that are not covered by the patent.\n",
    "Governments seeking to establish patent laws face a difficult dilemma. If their patent laws are strong, then much of the modern technology in the economy will be restricted in use. Technology may be restricted to being used only by the inven  tor or restricted because the inventor is allowed to charge other firms high licens  ing fees to use it (or to not let them use it at all). Letting everyone use the idea or the process or the innovation, once it is discovered, entails no social cost. Infor  mation, after all, wants to be free. Thus a government that enacts strict patent laws is pushing the average level of technology used in its factories and businesses at some particular moment far below the level that could be achieved at that partic  ular moment.\n",
    "On the other hand, if the patent laws are weak and thus provide little protec  tion to inventors and innovators, then the profits that inventors and innovators earn will be low. Why then should businesses devote money and resources to research and development? They will not. And the pace of innovation, and thus of technological improvement, will slow to a crawl.\n",
    "This dilemma cannot be evaded. The profits from innovation derive from the innovator’s monopoly right to the innovation — and hence the rest of the econ  omy is excluded from using that item of technology. Reduce the degree of exclu  sion to lower the deadweight loss from using less-than-best-practice technology, and you will End that you have reduced the rewards to research and development (and thus presumably the pace of R&D as well). Increase the strength of the patent system to raise the rewards to research and development, and you will End that you have increased the gap between the average technology used in the economy and the feasible best practice.\n",
    "Moreover, technological progress depends on more than the appropriability of research — the extent to which the increased productivity made possible by inno  vation boosts the profits of the innovating firm. It also depends on the productiv  ity of research: How much in the way of new productivity-enhancing inventions is produced by a given investment in R&D? Economists don’t know much about the interactions among product development, applied research, and basic research, so they have little to say about how to improve the productivity of research and the pace of productivity growth.\n",
    "Government Failure\n",
    "That governments can assist in growth and development does not mean that gov  ernments will. The broad experience of growth in developing economies — outside the Asian Pacific Rim, outside the OECD — has been that governments often won’t.\n",
    "\n",
    " Over the past two decades many have argued that typical systems of regulation in developing countries have retarded development by\n",

    "shifting to activities in which the country has a long-run comparative\n",
    "advantage.\n",
    "• Inducing firms and entrepreneurs to devote their energies to seeking rents by\n",
    "lobbying governments, instead of seeking profits by lowering costs.\n",
    "• Creating systems of regulation and project approval that have degenerated\n",
    "into extortion machines for manufacturing bribes for the bureaucrats.\n",
    "Many governments — particularly unelected governments — are not that interested in economic development. Giving valuable industrial franchises to the nephews of the dictator; making sure that members of your ethnic group are in key places to extort bribes; or taking the foreign exchange that would have been spent import  ing productive machinery and equipment and using it instead to buy more mod  ern weapons for the army — these can seem more attractive options. In the absence of political democracy, the checks on a government that does not seek economic development are few.\n",
    "Moreover, checks on government that do exist may not be helpful. In a non  democracy, or a shaky semidemocracy, government faces two possible sources of pressure: riots in the capital and coups by the soldiers. Even a government that seeks only the best for its people in terms of economic growth will have to deal with these sources of pressure and will have to avoid riots in the capital and coups by the soldiers.\n",
    "Riots in the capital are best avoided by making sure that the price of food is low and that influential opinion leaders in the capital are relatively happy with their material standards of living. Coups by the soldiers are best avoided by spending money on the military. Thus governments find themselves driven to poli  cies that redistribute income from the farms to the cities, from exporting businesses to urban consumers of imported goods, from those who have the power to invest and make the economy grow to those who have the power to overthrow the government.\n",
    "If the rulers have the worst of motives, government degenerates into kleptoc- racy: rule by the thieves. If government has the best of motives, it is still hard to avoid policies that diminish saving and retard the ability to translate saving into productive investment. W. W. Rostow recounts a visit by President Kennedy to Indonesia in the early 1960s; Kennedy talked about economic development and a South Asian Development Bank to provide capital for Indonesia’s economic growth. Indonesia’s then-dictator, Sukarno, responded, “Mr. President, development takes too long. Give me West Irian [province, the western half of the island of New Guinea, to annex] instead.”\n",

    "Chapter Summary\n",
    "1. Before the commercial revolution (1500 or so) eco  nomic growth was very slow. Populations grew at a glacial pace. And as best we can tell there were no sig  nificant increases in standards of living for millennia before 1500: Humanity was caught in a Malthusian trap.\n",
    "2. The way out of the Malthusian trap opened about 1500. Thereafter populations grew, and standards of living and levels of material productivity grew as well.\n",
    "3. The Industrial Revolution was the start of the current epoch: the epoch of modern economic growth. Begin  ning in the mid-eighteenth century the pace of inven  tion and innovation ratcheted up. Key inventions\n",
    "replaced muscle with machine power, and material pro  ductivity levels boomed.\n",
    "4. Modem economic growth is well described by the growth model in Chapter 4, which is why we spent so much time on it. Output per worker and capital per worker increase at a pace measured in percent per year, a pace that is ex  traordinarily rapid in long-term historical perspective.\n",
    "5. Productivity growth rates slowed down worldwide after 1973, causing living standards to rise more slowly in the 1970s and 1980s than they otherwise would have. Sev  eral explanations have been offered for the productivity growth slowdown, but economists generally agree the causes remain a mystery.\n",
    "infrastructure development, provision of social insurance — at which it is effec  tive. But there is a large area of potential activities in which governments (or, at least, governments that do not have the bureaucratic honesty and efficiency needed for a successful developing state) are more likely to be destructive than constructive, hence the neoliberal recommendation that governments attempt to shrink their role back to their core competencies and thus to deregulate indus  tries and privatize public enterprises. Whether such policies will in fact lead to convergence rather than continued divergence is still an open question.\n",
    "RECAP POLICIES AND LONG-RUN GROWTH\n",
    "Most people today live in economies that, while far poorer than the leading- edge postindustrial nations of the world’s economic core, have successfully climbed onto the escalator of economic growth and thus the escalator to modernity. A follower economy with a higher level of educational attainment is likely to have a much more successful time at adapting to local conditions inventions and innovations from the industrial core of the world economy. Thus education appears to be a key policy for successful economic growth out  side the industrial core. Inside the industrial core, without better technology increases in the capital stock produced by investment rapidly run into dimin  ishing returns. One-fifth of total gross investment is research and development. More than half of net investment is research and development — investment in knowledge, as opposed to investment in machinery, equipment, structures, and infrastructure.\n",

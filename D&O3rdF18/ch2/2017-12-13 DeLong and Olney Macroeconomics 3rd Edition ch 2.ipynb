They sell their goods to people here, who have home currency — in the case of the United States, dollars — to pay them.\n",

Foreign producers need to trade the dollars they have earned from selling us imports for money that is useful to them; domestic exporters need to trade the foreign cur  rency they have earned by selling exports for dollars that they can use.\n",

They turn to the foreign exchange market, where those who have foreign currency — say, euros € — but want dollars exchange it for dollars, and those who have dollars but want foreign currency exchange dollars for other currencies. Those with for  eign currency who want dollars include not only domestic exporters but also foreigners wishing to invest in the United States.

When the real exchange rate — the rate in terms of goods and services — changes, the pattern of cross-national trade will change as well.

Stocks are shares of ownership of a corporation, and they give you ownership of that corporation’s profits or earnings. Bonds are debts that the cor  poration owes you. A bond is a piece of paper that gives you periodic interest pay  ments and, at the bond’s maturity, returns to you the principal amount of the bond.\n",

Call this real rate of inter  est in the economy r If you invest in shares of stock, what is your rate of return? You paid a price Ps (P for price, s for stock) for each share. The corporation reports earnings Es per share. Some of those earnings will be paid out directly to share  holders in the form of dividends.

To apply the stock-price valuation formula, you also need an estimate of the relationship between the current earnings Ea that you see in the newspaper and “permanent” earnings Es. (See Figure 2.3.)"

    "\n",
    "The interest rate is the price at which purchasing power can be shifted from the future into the present — borrowed today with a promise to pay it back with interest in the future. Interest is not a single lump sum but an ongoing stream of payments made over time. Thus it is what economists call a flow variable. A flow variable cannot be measured simply as a quantity; it must be measured as a quantity per unit of time. In the case of the interest rate, it is measured not just as a percentage of the amount borrowed, the principal, but as a percentage per year\n",
    "Economists like to talk about “the” interest rate in the same way that they like to talk about “the” exchange rate. But just as there are a large number of differ  ent exchange rates, there are a large number of interest rates. Loans of higher risk carry higher interest rates: Whomever you lent your money to might not pay it back — that is a risk you accepted when you lent in the first place. Loans of different duration carry different interest rates as well. Moreover, differences in tax treatment — whether and when you have to pay taxes on interest earned from bonds — also lead to differences in interest rates. Thus even U.S. government bonds — the ultimate in safe investments — have no single interest rate. Table 2.3 shows a small sample of the interest rates — the column labeled “yield” — quoted on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities between a few months and 30 years.\n",
    "Moreover, the interest rates published in the newspaper are nominal rates: They tell how much money you earn in interest per year if you lend out a sum of dol  lars now and collect the principal at the loan’s maturity. You will not be surprised to learn that economists are interested instead in the real interest rate: how much purchasing power over goods and services you get in the future in return for trad  ing away your purchasing power over goods and services today.\n",
    "When we calculate real exchange rates, or real stock values, or real GDP, we divide the nominal exchange rate or stock index value or nominal GDP level by the price level, but that is not what we do to calculate real interest rates. Instead of dividing the nominal interest rate by the price level, we subtract the inflation rate — the percentage rate of change in the price level — from the nominal inter  est rate to get the real interest rate. Box 2.2 explains how."

    "Why subtract the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate? Suppose you bor  row \\$10 million for one year at a nominal interest rate of 8 percent per year. Sup  pose further that the annual inflation rate is also 8 percent, so the price level will rise by 8 percent between now and next year. Thus whatever goods you want to buy will be more expensive. Let’s say you want to buy television sets priced at \\$200 a set this year; they will cost \\$216 a set by next year.\n",
    "Right now when you borrow, you get \\$10 million. Next year you will have to pay back \\$10.8 million — \\$10 million principal and \\$800,000 interest. You borrow enough now to buy 50,000 TV sets. Next year, when you pay back your loan with interest, you will pay the lender \\$10.8 million, just enough money to buy 50,000 TV sets. Thus you will return the same purchasing power over goods and services as what you borrowed, making a real interest rate of zero (see Figure 2.4).\n",
    "Suppose the inflation rate had been 4 percent, so the price of a standard basket of goods and services, and of the TV sets you are buying, will rise from \\$200 to \\$208 next year. You borrow \\$10 million, enough to buy 50,000 TV sets. Next year, when you pay back your loan with its 8 percent annual interest, you will pay the lender \\$10.8 million, enough money to buy 51,923 TV sets. The extra 1,923 TV sets are a 3.846 percent increase in purchasing power over goods and services. Thus you will return 3.846 percent more purchasing power than you borrowed. However, to keep things simple, economists round the percentage off and call it a 4 percent real interest rate. (You will find that economists often round off num  bers, drop small terms from equations, and generally do whatever they can to make things simpler.)\n",
    "Thus the rule: To calculate a real interest rate, subtract the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate."

    "Using relative expenditure levels in a fixed base year as the weights in a price index produces a kind of index that economists call a Laspeyres index. The CPI is a Laspeyres price index. Another type of index, a Paasche index, is in a sense the opposite of a Laspeyres index. The expenditure weights in a Laspeyres index are fixed: A Laspeyres index of production or consumption counts up the current dol  lar value of what is produced or consumed and divides by what the value of what is produced or consumed would have been if all commodities had sold for their prices in the base year. The expenditure weights in a Paasche index are variable: If expenditures on a particular good rise this year and make it a large part of the cur  rent dollar value, then that good’s weight in the price index will rise too. The sec  ond most-often-seen indicator of the price level, the GDP deflator, is a Paasche index. Box 2.4 compares the pluses and minuses of these two kinds of price indexes.\n",
    "In general, a Laspeyres index overstates price increases. In the real world, when some items become expensive, consumers substitute and buy other items that remain cheap. But a Laspeyres index, because it is based on a fixed market basket of goods and services, does not take account of this substitution. Thus it suffers from what economists call substitution bias, and it tends to overstate changes. A Paasche index, on the other hand, understates the increase in fruit prices. It calculates the differ  ence between the price today of the fruit you bought and the price back in the base year. The Paasche index takes account of substitution. But it doesn’t take account of the fact that the substituted items are less valued than the items they replace. The Paasche index reports, in the example of Box 2.4, that the skyrocketing price of oranges has no effect on fruit prices. Yet it makes no sense to say that a frost that makes oranges completely unaffordable has no effect on the price of fruit.\n",
    "So which is the “correct” price index? Neither: There is no final and definitive resolution to this “index number problem.” All price indexes are imperfect. All try to summarize in a single number what is inherently a multidimensional reality of many prices changing in different directions and different proportions.\n",
    "To strike a balance between the two types of indexes and their two types of biases, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Labor Depart  ment’s Bureau of Labor Statistics have begun to move toward hybrid indexes. To reduce substitution bias, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has begun using geometric averages — multiply two numbers together and take the square root — instead of arithmetic averages. And the Bureau of Economic Analysis has begun using a pro  cedure called chain weighting to construct its indexes.\n",
    "With chain weighting, each year’s proportional change in the index is calculated using a different base year. For instance, the percentage change in the index from 1999 to 2000 is calculated using the average of 1999 and 2000 as the base; the change from 2000 to 2001 is calculated using the average of 2000 and 2001 as the base; and the change from 2001 to 2002 is calculated using the average of 2001 and 2002 as the base. The results of these calculations are then “chained” together to make up the index."

Being unemployed is not pleasant, and neither is fearing unemployment for no other reason than the turn  ing of the wheel of the business cycle.\n",

Someone in group 3, who wants a job but has given up looking, certainly feels unemployed and may well feel as unemployed as someone in group 4. Perhaps these discouraged workers should be included in the unemployment rate. Furthermore, some people in group 1 have part-time jobs but want full-time jobs. Perhaps these part-timers for economic reasons should be counted as unemployed, or as half-unemployed.\n",
    "Economists have noted striking and persistent variations in unemployment by demographic group and class. Teenagers age 16 to 19 have higher unemployment rates than adults, African-Americans have higher unemployment rates than whites, and high school dropouts have higher unemployment rates than those who have postgraduate degrees. For most of the post-World War II period (but not recently) women have had higher unemployment rates than men. Significantly, recessions don’t just raise the unemployment rate; they disproportionately raise the unem  ployment rate among these high-unemployment groups. Figure 2.7 contrasts the unemployment rates of various groups of workers.\n",

    "The question “How long is the typical person who loses his or her job unem  ployed?” is hard to answer because it is ambiguous. Most people who become unemployed on any one day — say, July 16, 2005 — remain unemployed for only a short time; more than half find a job within a month. Yet of all the people who are unemployed on July 16, 2005, some three-quarters will be unemployed for more than two months before they find another job."

Specifically, in the United States a 1-percentage-point fall in the unemployment rate is associated with an extra 2.5 percentage points of growth in real GDP relative to potential output. For example, in a year in which potential output grew 2 percent and the unemployment rate fell by 1 percentage point, real GDP would grow by fully 4.5 percent.\n",
    "Because of Okun’s law, if you know what is happening to real GDP relative to potential output, you have a good idea of what is happening to the unemployment rate, and vice versa. Box 2.5 explains the details of Okun’s law."

Note that before 1974 the real GDP growth rate that kept unemployment con­ stant was about 4 percent per year. Between 1974 and 1995, the unemploy­ ment rate was constant when real GDP growth was about 2.8 percent per year. Since 1995 there have been signs that the old pre-1974 relationship is reemerging. We call the rate of growth at which the unemployment rate is con­ stant the rate of growth of potential output. The fall in the rate of growth of po­ tential output after 1973 — the so-called productivity growth slowdown — is one of the most important fea­ tures of recent American economic history."

    "Okun’s law sees not a 1-to-l relation but a 2.5-to-l relationship between real GDP growth and the unemployment rate. That is, a 1-percentage-point fall in the unem  ployment rate is associated not with a 1 but a 2.5 percent boost in the level of production.\n",
    "Why is the Okun’s law coefficient so large? Why isn’t it the case that a 1- percentage-point fall in unemployment produces a 1 percent rise in output, or even less? Part of the answer is that the unemployment rate, as officially measured, does not count discouraged workers. In a recession, the number of people at work falls, the number of people looking for work rises, and the number of people who are not looking for work because they doubt they could find jobs — but who would be working if business conditions were better — rises. When conditions improve, many of these discouraged workers return to the labor force. Because the conven  tionally measured unemployment rate does not include these discouraged work  ers, more than a 1 percent rise in real GDP is needed to reduce the unemployment rate by 1 percentage point.\n",
    "In addition, when business returns to normal, firms’ initial response is not to hire more employees but to ask existing employees to work longer hours. So average hours of work per week go up, and the unemployment rate falls by less than one would otherwise expect.\n",
    "Finally, in some industries, employing more workers increases production by more than a proportional amount: Product design and setup need to be done only once, no matter how much is produced. Thus businesses that have economies of scale do not need twice as many workers to produce twice as much output.\n",
    "Since 2000 the quantitative form of Okun’s law has shifted: The Okun’s law coef  ficient appears to have grown even larger than 2.5. More than 2.5 percent growth of real GDP relative to potential output is now needed to lower the unemployment rate by 1 percentage point. We are not yet sure whether Okun’s law will return to its old pattern or, if it does not, what the new quantitative relationship between unemployment and the output gap is. Many economists think that the relatively stagnant employment levels seen between 2000 and 2005 led a great many people who would seek jobs in normal times to temporarily drop out of the labor force, and so artificially lowered the unemployment rate. We must wait a few years to learn whether the change in the Okun’s law coefficient is permanent, tern- ^ porary, or — allowing for measurement error — even nonexistent!"

    "Real GDP is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services pro  duced in the economy. Because it measures the rate at which goods and services are produced, real GDP is a flow variable; it is usually expressed as an annual amount. Often, however, you will not hear the phrase “per year.” But when you hear that real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2002 was such and such, remember that such a statement means that the flow of production in the fourth quarter was such and such per year. And when you hear that real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2002 grew at so-and-so percent, remember that such a statement means that real GDP in the fourth quarter grew at so-and-so percent per year — the difference between real GDP in the third quarter and real GDP in the fourth quarter is only one-quarter of the reported annual growth rate.\n",
    "What are the final goods and services that make up GDP? A final good or serv  ice is something that is not used further in production during the course of the year. Thus final goods and services include\n",
    "• Everything bought by consumers.\n",

    "as an investment to increase the business’s capital stock and expand its future\n",
    "production capacity.\n",
    "• Everything bought by the government.\n",
    "Because GDP measures product and not spending, it includes a balancing item, exports minus imports. Because exported goods bought by foreigners were made in the United States, they are part of GDP and need to be added to the total. Because imported goods bought by consumers, installed as pieces of investment, or bought by the government were not made in the United States, they are not part of gross domestic product, so imports need to be subtracted from GDP."

The answer is that they use market value — what people paid for a good or service — in the calculation of nominal GDP. Box 2.6 presents a stylized, hypothetical example of how this is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2003 nominal GDP (that is, GDP measured at 2003 prices) was \\$11.00 tril  lion; in 2002 nominal GDP (that is, measured at 2002 prices) was \\$10.49 trillion. Thus the growth rate of nominal GDP between 2002 and 2003 was 4.9 percent. But this nominal measure of GDP, in which current-year prices are used to weight the final goods and services produced and to calculate growth rates, is clearly not a good measure of productivity or material output. It confuses changes in the over  all price level — inflation or deflation — with changes in total production. Suppose production in the next year stayed unchanged but prices doubled; nominal GDP would double. Suppose production doubled but prices stayed the same; nominal GDP would also double. Although nominal GDP does not distinguish between these two sources of increase in total expenditure, we need to distinguish between them. Hence economists favor real GDP — the value of final goods and services weighted by the prices of some particular base year. Box 2.7 illustrates the weight  ing of goods and services in terms of base-year prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you hear a statement such as “Real GDP in 2002 was 10.07 trillion 2000 dollars,” remember that “2000 dollars” means that 2000 is the base year of the calculation. When measured using 2000 prices, GDP in 2002 — real GDP — was not \\$10.49 trillion but only \\$10.07 trillion. The difference, the gap between \\$10.49 trillion and \\$10.07 trillion, was due to price inflation between 2000 and 2002. Real GDP between 2002 and 2003 rose by only 3.0 percent, not 4.9 percent.\n",

While the GDP deflator takes account of purchasers’ ability to substitute away from items that have increased prices, it does not take account of the reduction in utility — the implicit cost to consumers — of settling for second best."

Thus so- called intermediate goods — goods sold to another business for use in further production — are excluded from GDP. A product made by one business and sold to another will eventually show up in the national income and product accounts and be counted as part of GDP. It will show up when the second business sells its product (which will by then embody the value added by the first producer) to a consumer, an investor, a foreign purchaser, or the government. Meanwhile, because the value of an intermediate good is included in the price of the final good that the intermediate good is used to make, its value must be excluded from GDP.\n",
    "For example, if a builder buys wood from a lumber mill to build a house, the value of the wood becomes part of the value of the house. To count the sale of the wood to the home builder as well as the sale of the newly built house to its pur  chaser would be to count the wood twice. And what would happen if the builder bought the lumber mill and thus no longer had to buy finished wood? GDP should not go down just because two businesses have merged.\n",
    "One way to think about intermediate goods is that GDP represents the economic value added at every stage of production. The value added by any one business is equal to the total value of the firm’s products minus the value of the materials and intermediate goods the firm purchases. In computing value added from start to fin  ish, each intermediate good and service enters the calculation twice: once with a plus sign, when the value added of the business that made the good is calculated, and once with a minus sign, when the value added of the business that uses the good is calculated. Using this value-added approach, every good and service in the economy cancels out except those that are not sold to other businesses for use in the production process. The goods whose values do not cancel out are the final goods and services — consumption goods, goods purchased by the government, goods purchased as part of investment, and net exports."

Some intermediate goods will not have been used to produce goods for final sale. The value has already been added in making the intermediate good, but no final good that embodies that value has yet been sold. The NIPA finesses this problem by treating inventories at the end of a period as a special kind of final good, a form of investment. A business that produces intermediate goods or final goods and doesn’t sell them by the end of the year is treated as having “purchased” those goods for itself as part of its capital stock. The general rule is that whenever a business increases its end-of-period inven  tory, that increase is counted as a component of investment and of final demand.\n",

    "The largest such “imputation” in the NIPA is found in housing. When somebody rents an apartment or a house, the rent he or she pays to the landlord becomes part of GDP as the purchase of “housing services” by the renter. When a landlord rents a house to a tenant, the landlord is selling a service — the usefulness of having a roof over the renter’s head— just as a barber is selling a service when a customer gets a haircut. Thus rent is one item in consumer spending on services.\n",

That is, the work family members do to keep their own households going, for which they are not paid, is excluded from GDP. This exclusion warps our picture of the U.S. economy. In 2000 some 129 million Americans, male and female, worked a total of about 206 billion paid hours (and some 7 million Americans spent a total of 5 billion hours looking for jobs). But many Americans — most of them adult women — also spent at least 100 billion hours performing services such as cooking, cleaning, shopping, and chauffeuring that would count as employment and would count in GDP if they were receiving pay for them rather than doing them for their own families.

    "\n",
    "Real GDP is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services pro  duced in the economy Because it measures the rate at which goods and services are produced, real GDP is a flow variable: Remember that real GDP is measured as the value of goods and services produced per year. Real GDP has four compo  nents: (1) consumer spending for final goods and services, (2) investment spend  ing by firms to increase their capital stock, (3) purchases of goods and services by the government (including the time of bureaucrats), and (4) net exports.\n",

    "**Summary**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because economics studies goods and services that flow through the market and are bought and sold with prices attached, economists have a lot of quantitative data to work with.\n",
    "2. The real exchange rate is the relative price at which two countries’ goods exchange for each other. You calculate it by adjusting the nominal exchange rate for changes in the price levels in the two countries.\n",
    "3. The level of the stock market is a valuable summary in  dex of a range of factors that affect investment: the cur  rent level of profits, investors’ optimism or pessimism, the real rate of interest, and attitudes toward risk.\n",
    "4. Real interest rates are much more important variables to keep track of than are nominal interest rates. Calculate the real interest rate by subtracting the rate of inflation from nominal interest rates.\n",
    "5. The most commonly seen measure of the price level is the consumer price index (CPI). The proportional rate of change of the price level is called the inflation rate.\n",
    "6. Unemployment and total output are linked through Okun’s law: A 1-percentage-point change in the unem  ployment rate comes with a 2.5 percent change in the opposite direction in the level of output relative to po  tential output.\n",
    "7. Real GDP is the most frequently seen measure of the over  all level of economic activity. It is the value — calculated using market prices in some chosen base year — of all fi  nal goods and services produced in a year.\n",
    "8. The line between what’s in GDP and what’s not in GDP is principally the result of economists’ beliefs in the 1940s and 1950s about what could be readily measured. It is not the result of a set of principled decisions about what kinds of activities should and should not be in  cluded in a measure of material welfare.\n",

    "1. In 1979 the (short-term) nominal interest rate on three- month Treasury bills averaged 10 percent, and the GDP deflator rose from 50.88 to 55.22.\n",
    "a. What was the annual rate of inflation in 1979? What\n",
    "was the real interest rate in 1979?\n",
    "b. Were real interest rates higher in 1979 or in 2003,\n",
    "when the (short-term) nominal interest rate on three- month Treasury bills was 1.0 percent and the infla  tion rate was 1.7 percent?\n",
    "2. In 1992 the implicit GDP deflator (in 1992 dollars) was equal to 100; in 1993 it was equal to 102.64. What was the annual rate of inflation between 1992 and 1993? In 1993 the implicit GDP deflator (in 1992 dollars) was equal to 102.64; in 1994 it was 105.09. What was the annual rate of inflation between 1993 and 1994?\n",
    "3. In 1992 both nominal GDP and real GDP (measured in 1992 dollars) were equal to \\$6,244 trillion. By 1997 nominal GDP had risen to \\$8,111 trillion, and the im  plicit GDP deflator had risen to 111.57. What was real GDP in 1997? What was the average rate of real GDP growth between 1992 and 1997?\n",
    "4. In 1997 nominal GDP was \\$8,111 trillion, and the im  plicit GDP deflator (measured in 2000 dollars) was 93.85. By 2003 nominal GDP had risen to \\$10,977 tril  lion, and the implicit GDP deflator had risen to 105.64. What was real GDP in 2003?

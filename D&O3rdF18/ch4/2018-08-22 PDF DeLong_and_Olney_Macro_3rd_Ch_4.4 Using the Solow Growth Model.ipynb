Then we will have one (or more) of the parameters—the savings-investment rate s, the labor force growth rate n, the labor efficiency growth rate g—jump discontinuously, and then remain at its new level indefinitely. The jump will shift the balanced growth path. But the level of output per worker will not immediately jump. Instead, the economy's variables will then, starting from their old balanced growth path values, begin to converge to the new balanced growth path—and converge in the standard way.\n",

    "\n",
    "Real-world economies exhibit profound shifts in labor-force growth. The average woman in India today has only half the number of children that the average woman in India had only half a century ago. The U.S. labor force in the early eighteenth century grew at nearly 3 percent per year, doubling every 24 years. Today the U.S. labor force grows at 1 percent per year. Changes in the level of prosperity, changes in the freedom of migration, changes in the status of women that open up new categories of jobs to them (Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor could not get a private-sector legal job in San Francisco when she graduated from Stanford Law School even with her amazingly high class rank), changes in the average age of marriage or the availability of birth control that change fertility—all of these have powerful effects on economies’ rates of labor-force growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "What effects do such changes have on output per worker Y/L—on our mea sure of material prosperity? The faster the growth rate of the labor force n, the lower will be the economy’s balanced-growth capital-output ratio s/(n + g - δ). Why? Because each new worker who joins the labor force must be equipped with enough capital to be productive and to, on average, match the productivity of his or her peers. The faster the rate of growth of the labor force, the larger the share of current investment that must go to equip new members of the labor force with the capital they need to be productive. Thus the lower will be the amount of invest  ment that can be devoted to building up the average ratio of capital to output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sudden and permanent increase in the rate of growth of the labor force will lower the level of output per worker on the balanced-growth path. How large will the long-run change in the level of output be, relative to what would have happened had labor-force growth not increased? It is straightforward to calculate if we know the other parameter values, as is shown in Box 4.4.1.\n",

Other factors—a higher saving-investment rate, lower labor-force growth rate, or lower depreciation rate—can and down.

    "Shifts in labor force growth rates do happen: changes in immigration policy, the coming of cheap and easy contraception (or, earlier, widespread female literacy), or increased prosperity and expected prosperity that trigger \"baby booms\" can all have powerful and persistent effects on labor force growth down the pike. Shifts in the growth of labor efficiency growth happen as well: economic policy disasters and triumphs, countless forecasted \"new economies\" and \"secular stagnations\", and the huge economic shocks that were the first and second Industrial Revolutions—the latter inaugurating that global era of previously unimagined increasing prosperity we call modern economic growth—push an economy's labor efficiency growth rate g up or down and keep it there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the most frequent sources of shifts in the parameters of the Solow growth model are shifts in the economy’s saving-investment rate. The rise of politicians eager to promise goodies—whether new spending programs or tax cuts — to voters induces large government budget deficits, which can be a persistent drag on an economy’s saving rate and its rate of capital accumulation. Foreigners become alternately overoptimistic and overpessimistic about the value of investing in our country, and so either foreign saving adds to or foreign capital flight reduces our own saving- investment rate. Changes in households’ fears of future economic disaster, in households’ access to credit, or in any of numerous other factors change the share of household income that is saved and invested. Changes in government tax policy may push after-tax returns up enough to call forth additional savings, or down enough to make savings seem next to pointless. Plus rational or irrational changes in optimism or pessimism—what John Maynard Keynes labelled the \"animal spirits\" of individual entrepreneurs, individual financiers, or bureaucratic committees in firms or banks or funds all can and do push an economy's savings-investment rate up and down.\n",

    "In late 2017 and early 2018 the Trump administration and the Republican congressional caucuses pushed through a combined tax cut and a relaxation of spending caps to the tune of increasing the federal government budget deficit by about 1.4% of GDP.

    "1. The U.S. economy at the start of 2018 was roughly at full employment, or at least the Federal Reserve believed that it was at full employment and was taking active steps to keep spending from rising faster than their estimate of the trend growth of the economy, so a long-run Solow growth model analysis would be appropriate. \n",

There is some uncertainty about just how much additional investment is induced by reductions in the cost of capital, but... many economists believe that a 10% reduction in the cost of capital would lead to a 10% increase in the amount of investment. Simultaneously reducing the corporate tax rate to 20% and moving to immediate expensing of equipment and intangible investment would reduce the user cost by an average of 15%, which would increase the demand for capital by 15%....

    "\n",
    "4. \"Barro and I have clearly come to a different conclusion.... While I certainly respect Summers and Furman’s right to their views, I am not about to cede my professional judgment to others, in or out of government.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"There are legitimate differences of opinion on how much and how quickly the tax plan will affect investment decisions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \"Summers... and DeLong... have made the strongest case I know that equipment investment can have a large impact... much larger than in the conventional models.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7. \"I believe that the current reform may well have deviated further from the ideal had we not offered our analysis and advice.... Many factors other than economists’ textbook policy proposals affect the final product.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. \"The actual tax provisions people and businesses will be required to use have yet to be written, and will be determined partly by technical interpretations and regulations in the coming months.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Point (6) seems to me to be a red herring, at least as far as the policy change's effects on the growth rate are concerned. We—DeLong and Summers—believe that $ \\alpha $ is higher than the 1/3 assumed in the center-of-gravity of informed economic opinion analyses. A higher value of $ \\alpha $ both stretches out the time it takes for the economy to converge and magnifies the ultimate differential, and these effects roughly cancel out, leaving the near term growth rate effect unchanged. And a higher $ \\alpha $ magnifies both the boost from higher savings and the drag from those savings being diverted to finance larger government deficits. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overwhelming impression I get from Boskin's piece is one of extraordinary cognitive dissonance. If I sincerely believed that a policy change was likely to boost America's productivity and wealth by 7 percent, I would not be apologizing for it. I would be crowing from the rooftops. I would not be agreeing that \"the current tax bill could... have been better\". I would not be saying that the bar is the very low \"better than the status quo\". I would not be defending my participation in the process on the grounds that the bill would have been worse if I had washed my hands of it. I would not be saying that we need to work hard now to improve it because \"the actual tax provisions people and businesses will be required to use have yet to be written\". I would not be saying that there are legitimate differences of opinion and that I respect the judgemtns of those who think differently.\n",

An abnormally high price of capital goods can translate a reasonably high saving effort into a remarkably low outcome in terms of actual gross additions to the real capital stock. The late economist Carlos Diaz-Alejandro placed the blame for much of Argentina’s poor growth performance since World War II on trade policies that restricted imports and artificially boosted the price of capital goods. Economist Charles Jones reached the same conclusion for India.

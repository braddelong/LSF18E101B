    "## 4.2.1 Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case for all economic models, the Solow growth model consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Variables_: economic quantities of interest that we can calculate and  measure, denoted by letters (or maybe two letters) like L for the number of workers in the labor force or Y for the amount of useful goods and services produced in a year—real GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Behavioral relationships_: relationships that (1) describe how humans, making economic decisions given their opportunities and opportunity costs, decide what to do, and (2) that thus determine the values of the economic variables, represented by equations that have an economic variable on the left hand side and, on the right, a set of factors that determine the value of the variable and a rule of thumb for what that value is currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * _Parameters_: determine which out of a broad family of potential behavioral relations describes the behavior of the particular economic scenario at hand; the ability to work algebraically with parameters allows one to perform an enormous number of potential \"what-if?\" calculations very quickly and in a very small space\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Equilibrium conditions_: conditions that tell us when the economy is in a position of balance, when some subset of the variables are \"stable\"—that is, are either constant are changing in simple and predictable ways, usually represented by solutions of some system of the equations that are behavioral relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Accounting identities_: statements about the relationships between variables that are automatically and necessarily true because of the way the variables are defined, represented by equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every economic model has a single key principal economic variable at its heart. We will be most interested in that one variable—the one the model is organized around.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Solow growth model, the key variable is labor productivity: useful production per worker, how much the average worker in the economy is able to produce. We calculate output per worker by simply taking the economy’s level of real GDP or output Y, and dividing it by the economy’s labor force L. Real GDP is the estimated annual value of goods and services produced for final sale: that somebody buys them (or, at least, somebody thinks they will be bought) tells us that they are _useful_. The labor force is the number of workers with or actively looking for jobs. Output per worker, Y/L, is a different concept from output per capita, Y/Pop. Y/Pop is the average income that can be spent to benefit the people, received by them or somebody else. Output per worker Y/L is how much in the way of useful goods and services the aveage worker can produce annually. It is a proxy. Thus it is imperfect. But it is useful because it is a simple proxy for how prosperous an economy is considered as a mechanism for making the things people find necessary, convenient, or luxurious.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every economic model economists proceed with their analysis by looking for an equilibrium: a point of balance, a condition of rest, a state of the system toward which the model will converge over time. Economists look for equilibrium for a simple reason: either an economy is at its (or one of its) equilibrium position(s), or it is moving—and probably (or hopefully?) moving rapidly—to an equilibrium position. The Solow growth model is no exception—\n",
    "\n",
    "Once economists have found the equilibrium position toward which the economy tends to move, they then understand how the model will behave. And, if they have built the right model, it will tell you in broad strokes how the economy will behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "In economic growth, the equilibrium economists lookfor is an equilibrium in which the economy’s capital stock per worker, its level of real GDP per worker, and its efficiency of labor are all three growing at exactly the same proportional rate, a rate that remains constant over time. We will call this rate g, for growth.\n",

    "## 4.2.2 The Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with the most important behavioral relationship in the Solow growth model: the production function. Consider average worker, a worker whose productivity is simply Y/L, the economywide average. This average worker uses the economy’s current level of technology and organization. These are captured by the current value of the efficiency of labor E. This average worker also uses an average share of the economy’s capital stock, which variable we will denote by \"K\". (Why not \"C\"? Because we are reserving \"C\" for spending on consumption goods and services, as we will see later on.). The average worker has K/L worth of capital to amplify his or her productivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to describe how these two—efficiency of labor E and the capital-to-labor ratio K/L—affect the average worker’s productivity Y/L.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we write down a behavioral relationship that tells us how the average worker’s productivity Y/L is related to the efficiency of labor E and the amount of capital K/L at the average worker’s disposal. We give this behavioral relationship a name: the production function. Tell the production function what resources the economy’s average worker has available, and it will tell you how much output the typical worker can produce. In the Solow Growth Model, we seek a production function that will satisfy two rules of thumb:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A one percent increase in the capital at the disposal of the average worker—a one percent increase in K/L—will carry with it the same proportional increase in the level of labor productivity—of output per worker Y/L—with a factor of proportionality we will call α, a number between 1 and 0 that serves as a gauge of how quickly opportunities to amplify productivity via using more structures and machines are exhausted, and how rapidly diminishing returns set in. (Note that, when we apply the Solow growth model, different economies will have different values of α; the same economy may well have a different value of α at different times; and asking \"what would happen if the value of the factor of proportionality α were different?\" is one of the principal what-if questions and exercises we will want to undertake and analyze.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A one percent increase in how well technology and organization are used to boost the productivity of the average worker—a one percent increase in the _efficiency of labor_, which we will label E—will carry with it a 1 - α percent increase in the level of labor productivity—of output per worker Y/L. This is best thought of as a definition of what we mean by the _efficiency of labor_ E. (And why the same α here as in the first rule of thumb? Because it makes the ultimate equations we will work with in the model simpler, and it is harder to make mistakes when things are simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one and only one algebraic functional form that satisfies these two rule-of-thumb conditions. It is the so-called Cobb-Douglas function:\n",
    "\n",
    "(4.2.1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ \\frac{Y}{L} =  \\left({\\frac{K}{L}}\\right)^α \\left(E\\right)^{(1-α)}  $\n",
    " \n",
    "This gives us our quantitative rule for calculating what the economy’s level of annual output per worker Y/L will be. It will be equal to the capital stock per worker K/L raised to the power of a parameter α, and then multiplied by the current efficiency of labor E itself raised to the power (1—α).\n",

    "The production function has other, equivalent forms. When we are interested in not the level of output per worker but in the total level of output Y in the economy, we simply multiply both the left- and right-hand sides of the equation above by the labor force L to get the total output form of this Cobb-Douglas production function:\n",

    "This says just that there is a systematic relationship between output per worker Y/L—real GDP divided by the number of workers—and the economy’s available resources: the capital stock per worker K/L and the efficiency of labor E. The pattern of this relationship is prescribed by the form of the function F( ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why then assume the Cobb-Douglas form? Because it incorporates our two conditions above. These conditions, both of them, (a) are very reasonable rules of thumb, and (b) make our calculations much simpler and easier to understand. We can then give quantitative answers to any questions we are asked about the effects of changes in economic policy and the economic environment on economic growth, and those answers will depend solely on (a) how policy and the environment shift the values of K/L and E, and (b) the value of the economy's factor of proportionality α.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of α in the Cobb-Douglas production function tells us how rapidly the economic usefulness of additional investment in buildings, machines, and inventories declines as the economy accumulates more and more of them. That is, α measures how fast diminishing returns to investment set in in the economy. A value of α near zero means that the extra amount of output made possible by an additional unit of capital declines very quickly as the capital stock rises. A value of α near 1 means that each additional unit of capital makes possible almost as large an increase in output as the last additional unit. As α varies from a high number near 1 to a low number near 0, the force of diminishing returns to investment gets stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of illustrating this point in algebra is to use a little calculus to calculate the marginal product of capital, the MPK: how much total output increases as a result of a one-unit increase in the capital stock, dY/dK. For the Cobb-Douglas production function:\n",
    "\n",

    "$ MPK = \\frac{dY}{dK} = αK^{α-1}(EL)^{1-α} = α\\left(\\frac{Y}{K}\\right)  $\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the current capital-to-output ratio, the lower is the marginal product of capital. And the lower the parameter α, the lower is the marginal product of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4.2 shows what the production function looks like for five different values of α—from a low value of 0.15, in which case diminishing returns set in very quickly, to a high value of 0.75, in which case additional capital is very useful in production over a wide domain of values of capital per worker K/L. All five of the alternative production functions are calibrated so that the level of output per worker Y/L is 40 when the capital-labor ratio K/L is 200. Take away from this graph the flexibility of the Cobb-Douglas production function. It can be used to analyze economies in which the profits from investment and the boost to labor productivity from increasing the capital stock is high. It can be used to analyze economies in which the profits from investment and the boost to labor productivity from increasing the capital stock is low. It can be used to analyze economies in which the profits from investment and the boost to labor productivity from increasing the capital stock is intermediate.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Chapter 6 we will talk in detail about the circular-flow relationship you learned in your principles of cconomics class: The amount of output an economy produces (real GDP, or Y) equals total spending, with total spending divided into four parts, consumption spending C, investment spending I, government purchases G, and net exports NX, which equal gross exports minus imports, NX = GX — IM. Savings will then have business, household, and international components. And savings that actually occur _ex post_ and are translated into investment that increases the capital stock may well not be equal to what people had planned to save _ex ante_.\n",

The background assumption, however—made because it makes formulas much simpler—will be that s will remain at its current value as far as we look into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call s the economy’s saving rate or, more completely, its saving-investment rate (to remind us that s is measuring both the flow of saving into the economy’s financial markets and also the share of total production that is invested and used to build up and increase the economy’s capital stock).\n",

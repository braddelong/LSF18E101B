    "\n",
    "The two simulation runs presented above both made the hugely unrealistic assumptions of no labor force growth and no growth in the efficiency of labor. How does the model behave if we relax those unrealistic assumptions, and incorporate labor force and efficiency of labor growth? We can see the same way we saw above: assume various parameter values and initial conditions, and see what happens. Back when Robert Solow originally developed his model, computer time was so expensive that the only way to gain understanding was to solve the algebra and then think. Now, however, (as long as our programs run without bugs) we can directly see. Figure 4.14 presents the behavior of the model for the same parameter values as above, only with labor force growth at 1% per year and labor efficiency growth at 2% per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time the economy does not stagnate: there is no tendency for the economy's level of output or of output per worker or of the capital stock to head for some asymptote where they then stick. And there should not be. This model was built to understand the ongoing and—so far—fairly constant proportional growth that modern industrial economies have experienced since the Industrial Revolution. If our model predicted some eventual cessation of growth and subsequent stagnation, either we would have been doing it wrong, or it would be huge news. Indeed, there is no reason for output per worker to stagnate: labor is becoming more efficient and productive, and the other productive resource in the economy is capital, which is something labor can and does create. And with both efficiency and with both labor efficiency and the labor force increasing, there is no reason for output growth to approach any end. And with output increasing and savings a constant share of output, we would expect the capital stock to grow too.\n",

The capital stock is not rising but falling, as depreciation overwhelms gross investment.

    "Earlier, when we had assumed that labor force and efficiency were both constant, and thus that n and g were both equal to 0, our equilibrium condition was K/Y = s/δ. Since the saving-investment rate s and the depreciation rate δ were both constant, our equilibrium condition required that the capital-output ratio K/Y be constant as well. There was where the economy was in equilibrium, in balance, with a stable level of not only the capital-output ratio but of the capital stock and output as well.\n",

But this time, when the capital-output ratio is constant the economy's equilibrium is not one of stable and stagnant balance but rather one of _balanced growth_. Output per worker is then growing at the same rate as the capital stock per worker. Output is growing and the same rate as the capital stock. The former two per worker variables are in balance, and they are both growing at the same rate as the efficiency of labor. The latter two economy-wide aggregate variables are in balance, and they are growing at the same rate as the sum of labor efficiency growth and labor force growth.\n",

Then the growth rate of Y will be equal to a times the growth rate of K.\n",

The capital-output ratio will be constant—and therefore we’ll be in balanced-growth equilibrium — when K/Y = s/(n + g + δ). Add up the economy’s labor-force growth rate, efficiency-of-labor growth rate, and depreciation rate; divide the saving-investment rate by that sum; and that is your balanced-growth equilibrium capital-output ratio.\n",

There must be investment equal to δK to replace depreciated capital. There must be investment equal to nK to provide the extra workers in the labor force, which is expanding at rate n, with the extra capital they will need.

Then (n + g + δ)K would be less than the economy’s total investment which is equal to sY, the saving rate s times the level of output Y.

In addition, as before, draw the line that shows where the capital-output ratio is equal to its balanced-growth equilibrium value, K/Y = s/(n + g + δ). This line starts at the bottom left origin point (0, 0) and climbs toward the upper right.

    "To calculate what output per worker would be if the economy were to be on its balanced-growth path is a straightforward three-step procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the balanced-growth equilibrium capital-output ratio s/(n + g + δ), the saving rate s divided by the sum of the labor-force growth rate n, the efficiency of labor growth rate g, and the depreciation rate δ.\n",

    "3. Multiply the result by the current value of the efficiency of labor E. The result is the current value of what output per worker would be if the economy were on its balanced growth path, and the path traced out by that result as E grows over time is the balanced-growth path for output per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "But is this of use if the economy is not on its balanced growth path?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we use a model which assumes that the economy is on its balanced-growth path to analyze a sit  uation in which the economy is not on that path? We still can use the model—and this is an important part of the magic of economics—because being on the balanced-growth path is an equilibrium condition. In an economic model, the thing to do if an equilibrium condition is not satisfied is to wait and, after a while, look again. When we look again, it will be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the capital-output ratio K/Y is above its balanced-growth equilibrium value s/(n + g + δ), K/Y is falling: Investment is insufficient to keep the capital stock growing as fast as output. Whenever K/Y is below its balanced-growth equilibrium value, K/Y is rising: Capital stock growth outruns output. And as the capital-output ratio converges to its balanced-growth value, so does the economy’s level of output per worker converge to its balanced-growth path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that an economy converges to its balanced-growth path makes analyzing the _long-run_ growth of an economy relatively easy as well even when the economy is not on its balanced-growth path:\n",

    "1. Calculate the balanced-growth path.\n",

    "4. If the economy is not on its balanced-growth path today, it is heading for that path—and will get there, eventually.\n",

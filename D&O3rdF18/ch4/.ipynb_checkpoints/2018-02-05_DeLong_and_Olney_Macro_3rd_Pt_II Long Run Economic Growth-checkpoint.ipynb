    "Long-run economic growth: that is the subject of this two-chapter section. Chapter 4 covers, primarily, the the theory of growth. Chapter 5 covers, primarily, the worldwide pattern of economic growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section comes first for one reason: long-run economic growth is the most important topic in macroeconomics. The most important aspect of the economy considered as a whole, the macroeconomy, is that it grows—and grows faster and differently at some times and in some places than in others. Standards of living in the United States today are at least seven times what they were at the end of the nineteenth century. Successful economic growth has meant that almost all citizens of the United States today live better, and we hope happier, lives than even the rich elite of a century ago. The study of long-run economic growth aims at under  standing its sources and causes and at determining what government policies will promote or retard long-run economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognize, hoowever, that this two-chapter long-run growth section of the book, and the long-run growth portion of the discipline of macroeconomics, are, as modules, not very closely connected at all intellectually to the rest of the book and the subject. The rest is the study of business cycles, recessions, unemployment, inflation, and stabilization policy. Those are concerned with relatively short- and medium-run fluctuations that push production and employment down and up and make the economy perform less and more well as a societal institution for helping us attain well-being. Those studies that up by far the larger portion of this book—and of the discipline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the models used, the approaches taken, and the conclusions reached in this Part 2 section will by and large not be central to Part 3 and beyond, in which, starting with Chapter 6, we turn to business cycles.\n",

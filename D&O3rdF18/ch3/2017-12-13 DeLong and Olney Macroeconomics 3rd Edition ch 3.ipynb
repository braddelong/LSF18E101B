    "Every intellectual discipline has its own way of thinking about the world, which you need to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is, after all, what makes a subject a discipline: A discipline allows (and forces) people to think about a slice of the world in some new way.Economics is no exception. Think of it this way: There is a sense in which learning a new intellectual discipline like macroeconomics is similar to learning a new language. Economists’ way of thinking allows us to see the economy more sharply and clearly than if we were limited to thinking like a sociologist, or a political sci entist, or a business reporter. (Of course, restricting yourself to one mode of thought can also have costs. Thinking only like an economist can also cause us to miss certain relationships that are hard to quantify or hard to think of as purchases and sales. That is why economics is not the only social science, and we need sociologists, political scientists, historians, psychologists, and anthropologists as well.)\n",

    "#### 3.1.1 Economics: How Is It Like a Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are coming to economics from a background in the natural sciences, you probably expect economics to be something like a natural science, only less so: To the extent that it works, it works more or less like chemistry, though it does not work as well. Economic theories are unsettled and poorly described. Economists’ predictions are often wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you hold these opinions, you are half-right. \n",
    "\n",
    "While economics is like a science in many respects, it is not and cannot be identical to a natural science. It is a social science. Its subject is not electrons or elements but human beings: people and how they behave. \n",
    "\n",
    "This subject matter has several important consequences. Some of them make economics easier than a natural science, some of them make economics harder than a natural science, and some of them just make it different.\n",
    "\n",
    "First and perhaps most important, because economics is a social science, debates within economics last a lot longer and are much less likely to end in a clear consensus than are debates in the natural sciences. The major reason is that different people have different views of what makes a free, a good, a just, or a well-ordered society. They look for an economy that harmonizes with their vision of what a society should be. They ignore or explain away facts that turn out to be inconvenient for their particular political views. People are, after all, only human.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists try to approach the objectivity that characterizes most work in the natural sciences. After all, what is is, and what is not is not. Even if wishful thinking or predispositions contaminate the results of a single study, later studies can correct the error. But economists never approach the unanimity with which physi cists embraced the theory of relativity, chemists embraced the oxygen theory of combustion, and biologists rejected the Lamarckian inheritance of acquired char acteristics. Biology departments do not have Lamarckians. Chemistry departments do not have phlogistonists. But economics departments do have a wide variety of points of view and schools of thought Because economists never approach unanimity, maintaining a diversified intellectual portfolio is important in economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the fact that economics is about people means that economists cannot ethically undertake large-scale experiments. Economists cannot set up special sit uations in which potential sources of disturbance are reduced to a minimum, then observe what happens, and generalize from the results of the experiment (where sources of disturbance are absent) to what happens in the world (where sources of disturbance are common). Thus the experimental method, the driver of rapid progress in many of the natural sciences, is largely lacking in economics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This flaw makes economics harder to analyze, and it makes economists’ conclusions much more tentative and subject to dispute than is the case with natural sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the subjects economists study — people — have minds of their own. They observe what is going on around them, plan for the future, and take steps to avoid future consequences that they foresee and fear will be unpleasant. At times they simply do what they want, just because they feel like doing it. Thus in econ omists’ analyses the present often depends not just on the past but on the future as well — or on what people expect the future to be. Box 3.1 presents one exam ple of this: how people’s expectations of the future and particularly their fear that there might be a depression contributed to the coming of the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n",
    "\n",
    "This third wrinkle is the thing that does the most to make economics very hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural scientists can always assume the arrow of causality points from the past to the future. In economics people’s expectations of the future mean that the arrow of causality often points the other way, from the (anticipated) future back to the present. This means that sometimes in economics things will happen just because they are expected to happen — and that if they weren’t expected to happen, they would not."

    "**BOX: EXPECTATIONS AND THE COMING OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION: AN EXAMPLE**\n",
    "\n",
    "An important example of how people’s expectations can change the course of eco nomic events comes from the stock market crash of 1929. The crash changed what Americans expected about the future of the economy, and the shifts in spending caused by their changed expectations played a key role in causing the greatest eco nomic depression in American history, the Great Depression.On October 29, 1929, the price of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange suffered their largest one-day percentage drop in history. Stock values bounced back a bit initially, but by the end of the week they were down by more than a quarter (see Figure 3.1 on page 60). Gloom fell over Wall Street. Many people had lost a lot of money.At that time stock ownership was confined to the rich. Middle-class Americans owned little stock. Nonetheless, the crash affected their perceptions of the econ omy: Bad times were coming. Because people expected the economic future to be dimmer, many cut back on spending, especially on big-ticket consumer durables. The 1920s had been the first decade in which consumer credit was widely avail able to finance purchases of cars, refrigerators, stoves, and washing machines. With the economic future uncertain, spending on consumer durables collapsed. It made sense to borrow to buy a consumer durable only if you were confident that you could make the payments and pay off the loan. If you thought the economic future might be bad, you had a powerful incentive to avoid debt. And in the short run the easiest way to avoid debt is to refrain from purchasing large consumer durables on credit.You can probably guess what happened in the months after the crash. Most peo ple simply stopped buying big-ticket items like cars and furniture. This massive drop in demand reduced new orders for goods. The drop in output generated layoffs\n",

    "Even though most people’s incomes had not yet changed, their expectations of their future income had. The drop in demand produced by this shift in expectations helped bring on what people feared; it put America on the path to the Great Depression. The Great Depression happened in large part because people expected something bad to hap pen. Without that pessimistic shift in expectations triggered by the crash of 1929, there would have been no Great Depression.\n",

    "Reliance on Quantitative Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of the political complications, the nonexperimental nature, and the pecu liar problems of cause and effect in economics, the discipline of economics remains very quantitative. Economists are lucky in that almost everything that they study comes to us already labeled, measured, and quantified: prices, values, transactions all come with numbers attached or are numbers. Thus economics makes heavy use of arithmetic and algebra, whereas most of political science, sociology, and history do not. Economics makes heavy use of arithmetic to measure economic variables of interest. Economics makes heavy use of algebra in building the simplified,60\n",
    "3.1 Understanding Macroeconomics61stripped-down mathematical models that economists use to try to understand the relationships between these economic variables.The American economy is complex: 140 million workers, 10 million hrms, and 100 million households buying and selling some \\$30 trillion worth of final and intermediate goods and services per year. Economists must simplify it. You can’t talk about 140 million individuals and expect to understand everything. So you sim plify. You restrict your attention to a very few simple behavioral relationships — cause-and-effect links between economic quantities — and a handful of equilibrium conditions — conditions that must be satisfied for economic activity to be stable and for supply and demand to be in balance.What is a behavioral relationship? It’s something like a rule that relates the number of workers and the value of the capital stock to the total amount of goods and services produced in the economy. It’s something like a rule that tells us how consumer spending changes when household income changes. What’s an equlibrium condition? It’s something like supply equals demand. Economists attempt to capture these behavioral relationships and equilibrium conditions in simple algebraic equa tions and geometric diagrams. Then they try to apply their equations and graphs to the real world, while hoping that their simplifications have not made the model a distorted and faulty guide to how the real-world economy works.Among economists, the process of reducing the complexity and variation of the real-world economy to a handful of equations is knowm as “building a model.” Using models to understand what is going on in the complex real-world economy has been a fruitful intellectual strategy. But model building tends to focus on the variables and relationships that fit easily into the algebraic model. It overlooks other factors.An Emphasis on the AbstractEconomics might have developed as a descriptive science, like sociology or politi cal science. If it had, courses in economics would concentrate on economic insti tutions and practices and the institutional structure of the economy as a whole. But economics has instead become a more abstract science that emphasizes general prin ciples applicable to a variety of situations. Thus a large part of economics involves a particular set of tools. Economics is a unique way of thinking about the world that is closely linked with these analytical tools and is couched in a particular technical language and relies on a particular set of data. While you can get a lot out of soci ology and political science courses without learning to think like a sociologist or a political scientist (because of their focus on institutional description), you cannot get much out of an economics course without learning to think like an economist.behavioral relationshipA connection between economic variables that is the result of people's actions.equilibrium conditionA relationship between two economic quantities that holds because the operation of the system as a whole pushes the economy to a state in which the relationship holds.modelA construct that aims to establish relationships — usually quantitative — between and among economic variables.Introducing the Rhetoric of EconomicsSurrounding the models, economists build a special rhetoric: a set of analogies and metaphors that economists use to help laypeople grasp the functioning of the macroeconomy. Metaphors and analogies are the basic stuff of human thought. To understand something we do not know, we will often compare it to something we do know.Economics is no exception. In economics, curves “shift” and money has a “velocity.” When the central bank raises interest rates and throws people out of work, economists say that this “pushes the economy down the Phillips curve.” Conversely, when the central bank lowers interest rates and the economy booms, economists say that this “pushes the economy up the Phillips curve” — as if the\n",
    "62Chapter 3 Thinking Like an EconomistFIGURE 3.2Pushing the Economy Up the Phillips Curve Between 1986 and 1989 the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy reduced interest rates and increased total spending. Increased total spending meant that unemployment fell from 7 percent in 1986 to 5.3 percent in 1989. As unemployment fell, infla tion rose from 2.2 percent in 1986 to 3.8 percent in 1989. Economists talk about this change by saying, \"Between 1986 and 1989 the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy pushed the economy up and to the left along the Phillips curve\" (which depicts the short-run relationship between unemployment and inflation).Source: 2004 edition of The Economic Report of the President (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office).circular flowThe central, dominant metaphor in macroeconomics which states that purchasing power flows from businesses to households and back in a circular fashion.economy were a dot on a diagram drawn on a piece of paper, constrained to move along a particular curve called the Phillips curve, and monetary policy really did push the dot up and to the left (see Figure 3.2).As a student you should be conscious of (and a little critical of) the rhetoric of economics. If you don’t understand the metaphors, much of economics may sim ply be incomprehensible. All will become clear, or at least clearer, if you are con scious of the metaphors. For example, there is a central dominant metaphor in macroeconomics, the circular flow metaphor, without which discussions of the “velocity” of money are simply incomprehensible. The circular flow metaphor com pares the process of spending throughout the economy to the flow of a liquid. Thus if the total amount of spending increases but the quantity of money does not, the money must be “flowing” faster than it did in the past, since a fixed quantity of pieces of money are changing hands more often. Hence money must have a higher speed or velocity. Without the concept of spending as a circular flow of purchas ing power, references to the velocity of money will make no sense.Much of the rhetoric of economics can be reduced to four dominant concepts:• The image of the circular flow of purchasing power through the economy — the circular flow of economic activity.• The use of the word “market” to describe intricate and decentralized processes of exchange, as if all the workers and all the jobs in the economy really were being matched in a single open-air market.\n",
    "3.2 The Circular Flow of Economic Activity63• The idea of equilibrium: that economic processes tend to move the economy into some sort of balance and to keep the economy at this point of balance.• The use of graphs and diagrams as an alternative to arithmetic and equations as tools to express economic relationships. Economists identify equations with geometric curves; situations of equilibrium with points where curves cross; and changes in the economic environment or in economic policy with shifts in the positions of particular curves.We will look next at the circular flow of economic activity. The market, equilibrium, and the relationship between graphs and equations will be covered in later sections.equilibriumA state of balance in a particular market or in the economy as a whole.RECAP UNDERSTANDING MACROECONOMICS: While economies is a science, it is not a natural science. It is a social science. The ; subjects economists study — people—have minds of their own, and think ahead.. Thus in economics it is common for the (expected) future to influence the past, and chains of causation can get very tangled. Economics might have developed as a descriptive science, like sociology or political science. It didn’t. Economics,' instead, developed as an abstract, simplifying, model-oriented discipline.3.2 THE CIRCULAR FLOW OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITYWhen economists speak of the “circular flow” of economic activity, they have a def inite picture in mind. They see patterns of spending, income, and production as liq uid flowing through various sets of pipes. In this extended metaphor, categories of agents in the economy — all businesses, the government, all households — are the pools into and out of which the fluid of purchasing power (i.e., money) flows. Thus economists think of economic activity — the pattern of production and spending in the economy — as a circular flow of purchasing power through the economy.The circular flow metaphor allows them confidently to predict that changes in one part of the economy will affect the whole and to explain what the likely effects will be. It allows them to simplify economic behavior, to understand a great deal about the entire set of decisions made by all different agents in different parts of the economy by thinking of just a few typical decisions made by just a few abstract agents whose decisions nevertheless represent the decisions made by all the house holds, businesses, investors, consumers, and workers in the economy.The Circular Flow DiagramFigure 3.3 shows a simplified diagram of the circular flow. It omits the government and international trade. Nevertheless, it is a good starting point for our discussion. In this figure, money payments flow from firms to households as businesses pay their workers and their owners for their labor and capital. This is the income side of the circular flow: Firms buy the factors of production, capital and labor, from the households that own them. Money payments then flow from households to firms as households buy goods. This is the expenditure side of the circular flow: Households buy final goods and services from businesses. Note that these flows\n",
    "64Chapter 3 Thinking Like an EconomistFIGURE 3.3The Circular Flow DiagramHouseholds spend money buying the products made by businesses, and businesses turn around and spend the same money buying factors of production — workers' time and attention, finance, the use of land and other property — from households.balance: The purchasing power that firms earn by selling their goods is the same as the purchasing power that firms spend by buying factors of production, and the incomes of households are equal to their total expenditures.This simplified diagram is expanded in Figure 3.4 to take account of the roles of the government, financial markets, and international trade and investment. But the core idea of a balanced circular flow of purchasing power is still present. Along the top of the diagram there is still the flow of incomes to households from businesses as businesses purchase labor and other factors of production from the households that own them. All these components of business expenditure — rent, wages, salaries, benefits, interest, and profits — become the components of household income.At the bottom of the diagram are the uses of household incomes — consumption spending, taxes, and household saving. Consumption spending flows direcdy to busi nesses as households purchase consumption goods. Total taxes flow to the govern ment, which uses some of this revenue to make transfer payments — classified here as negative taxes — back to households, uses most of it for government purchases, and borrows the resulting government budget deficit from financial markets as the gov ernment funds its budget deficit by issuing bonds.Households save the portion of their incomes that is left over after taxes and consumption spending. This saving flows into financial markets as it is put into banks and mutual funds. Businesses seeking to invest draw on the pool of saving to gain financing for purchasing capital goods to expand their productive capacity. Exports serve as an addition to (and imports a subtraction from) total demand for domestically made products.At the right of Figure 3.4 we have the components of planned expenditure or aggregate demand: consumption spending, government purchases, investment spending, and net exports (which are, in the United States today, net imports, a subtraction from GDP, because imports are greater than gross exports).Within the business sector, businesses buy and sell intermediate goods from each other as they strive to produce goods and services and make profits. Within the house hold sector, households buy and sell assets from and to one another. These within- the-business-sector and within-the-household-sector transactions are important com ponents of the economy. But because they net out to zero within the business sector or within the household sector, they are not counted as part of the circular flow of economic activity. And so the circular flow diagram pays little attention to them, and\n",
    "3.2 The Circular Flow of Economic Activity65FIGURE 3.4The Circular Flow of Economic ActivityThis version of the circular flow is complicated by the addition of the government and financial markets to the diagram. Not all final goods and services are bought by households. Some are bought by the government, which taxes to raise resources to finance itself. Some are bought by businesses seeking to invest, which raise the needed resources by issuing stock, issu ing bonds, and borrowing — all of which take place in financial markets. This version is also complicated by its recognizing that there is a world outside, a world that buys the products of domestic businesses and that invests through domestic finan cial markets.\n",
    "66Chapter 3 Thinking Like an Economistmacroeconomics as a discipline does not focus on the exchange of intermediate goods between businesses or on the exchange of used goods between households.Is the circular flow still a little unclear? Let’s try to get a better grasp of it. Let’s take a closer look at one particular part of the circular flow: a dollar paid out by a business as a dividend to a shareholder who is a member of a household. The dollar is partial payment for a factor of production owned by the household — the capital that has been invested in the business by the shareholder. When the divi dend check is deposited, it becomes part of the shareholder’s household income. Three things happen to household income: Some of it is spent on consumption goods and services, some of it is paid to the government in taxes, and some of it is not spent but saved.Suppose the household doesn’t spend this particular dollar but simply keeps the money in the bank, thus saving it for future use. The bank will notice that it has an extra dollar on deposit and will loan that dollar out to a business in need of cash to build up its inventory. That business will then spend the dollar buying goods and services as it builds up its inventory As soon as the dollar shows up as a component of business investment spending, the circular flow is complete. The dollar’s worth of purchasing power has flowed from the business sector to the household sector, then flowed as part of the flow of savings into the financial mar kets, and finally flowed out of the financial markets and back to the business sec tor as part of business investment spending.Different Measures of the Circular FlowIncome, production, and expenditure can be measured at three different points in the circular flow:1. At the point where consumers, exporters, the government, and firms that are making investments purchase goods and services from businesses. This mea surement is real GDP, or total output. It is the total economywide production of final goods and services. It is the expenditure-side measure of the circular flow2. At the point in the circular flow where businesses pay households for the fac tors of production. Businesses need labor, capital, and natural resources, all factors of production owned directly or indirectly by households. When busi nesses buy factors of production, they provide households with incomes. This measurement is called total income, or national income. It is the income-side measure of the circular flow3. At the point where households decide how to use their income. How much do they save? How much do they pay in taxes? How much do they spend on consumption goods? This measure of the circular flow of economic activity is the uses-of-income measure.The measure used most frequently is the expenditure-side measure: the gross domestic product produced by firms and demanded by purchasers. It is estimated by summing the four components of spending (and sales) — consumption, gov ernment purchases, investment, and net exports. If we compare the expenditure- side measure of GDP with the income-side or uses-of-income measure, we will find that, aside from differences created by different accounting conventions, they are equal (see Box 3.2). They are equal because the circular flow principle is designed into the national income and product accounts (NIPA). Every expen diture on a final good or service is accounted for as a payment to a business. Every dollar payment that flows into a business is then accounted for as paid out\n",
    "3.2 The Circular Flow of Economic Activity67ACCOUNTING DEFINITIONS AND STATISTICAL DISCREPANCIES: TOOLSBecause of the technical details of national income accounting, the different mea sures of the circular flow do not exactly balance. The gap is the statistical discrep ancy. All pieces of GDP reported by the Commerce Department are estimates. All estimates are imperfect. It is not unusual for \\$90 billion a year to go “missing” in the circular flow; as Table 3.1 shows, this happened in the third quarter of 2004.TABLE 3.1Measures of the U.S. Circular Flow (in Billions of Dollars per Year), Third Quarter of 2004Gross domestic product \\$11,815Minus: Depreciation —1,498Equals: Net domestic product \\$10,317Plus: Net factor incomes from abroad +38Equals: Net national product \\$10,355Minus: Statistical discrepancy —90Equals: National income \\$10,265Source: Authors' calculations from the 2005 edition of The Economic Report of the President (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office).to somebody. It can be paid out as income — wages, fringe benefits, profits, inter est, or rent — or as an expenditure on goods or services of another business that then, in turn, purchases factors of production.What if you want to withdraw your income from the circular flow? Suppose, for instance, that you simply take the dollar bills you receive and use them to buy something old and precious from another household — a bar of gold, say. And sup pose you keep the bar of gold in your basement. Doesn’t that break the circular flow? The answer is that it does not. You no longer have your income, but the household that you bought the gold bar from does. That household will then spend it on consumption goods, save it, or have it taxed away.What if you decided not to spend your dollar bills, not to pay them in taxes, and not to save them in the bank? Suppose you decided to hide the dollar bills in your basement? Doesn’t that break the circular flow? The answer, again, is that it does not. When you hide the dollar bills in the basement, the Bureau of Engraving and Print ing will notice that the total number of dollar bills circulating in the economy has dropped. It will print up more dollar bills and hand them to the Treasury. The gov ernment will spend these extra dollar bills, and thus replace the ones you hid. The net effect is the same as it would be if you had saved the dollar bills by lending them out to the government through the purchase of a Treasury bond. There are only two differences between buying a Treasury bond and your basement storage scheme:1. You have a stack of dollar bills in your basement rather than a piece of paper with the words “Treasury bond” written on it.2. The government does not pay interest on the dollar bills stacked in your basement, but it does pay interest on its bonds. In the circular flow diagram, you saved your income, but you saved it in a relatively pointless way by mak ing the government an interest-free loan.\n",
    "68Chapter 3 Thinking Like an EconomistRECAP THE CIRCULAR FLOW OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITYMoney flows from households to firms as households buy goods. This is the “expenditure side” of the circular flow: Households buy final goods and services from businesses. Businesses then turn around and buy factors of production from households. These payments make up household income. This is the “income side” of the circular flow. The circular flow principle is that the two flows must match: In the economy as a whole, expenditure must equal income.33 PATTERNS OF ECONOMISTS' THOUGHTBesides the circular flow of economic activity, three other sets of concepts, not obvi ous to outsiders, dominate the patterns of economists’ thought: the idea of markets, the idea of equilibrium, and the use of math in the form of graphs and equations. Let’s look at each of these in turn — the first two briefly, and the last at much greater length.MarketsEconomists often speak as if all economic activity took place in great open-air mar ketplaces like those of medieval merchant cities. Contracts between workers and bosses are made in the “labor market.” All the borrowing of money from and the depositing of money into banks take place in the “money market.” Supply and demand balance in the “goods market.” Indeed, in the market squares of prein dustrial trading cities you could survey the buyers and sellers and form a good idea of what was being sold and for how much.In using the open-air markets of centuries past as a metaphor for the complex processes of matching and exchange that take place in today’s modem industrial economy, economists are assuming that information travels fast enough and buy ers and sellers are well enough informed for prevailing prices and quantities to be as they would be if we actually could walk around the perimeter of a marketplace and examine all buyers and sellers in an hour. In most cases this bet that a decen tralized matching process is like an open-air market will be a good intellectual bet to make. But sometimes (for example, in situations of so-called structural unem ployment, where people who could work effectively at some of the jobs in the econ omy find that those jobs are not open) it may not be.EquilibriumEconomists spend most of their time searching for the state of equilibrium — a point or points of balance at which some economic quantity is neither rising nor falling because the different economic forces pushing or pulling it up or down exactly counteract each other. The dominant metaphor is that of an old-fashioned scale whose two pans are in balance.The search for equilibrium is an attempt to simplify the problem of under standing how the economy will behave. Economists’ questions are much easier to analyze if we can identify “points of rest” where the pressures for economic quan tities to rise and fall are evenly balanced. Once the potential points of rest have been identified, economists can figure out how fast economic forces will push the\n",
    "3.3 Patterns of Economists' Thought69economy to those points of equilibrium. The search for points of equilibrium, fol lowed by an analysis of the speed of adjustment to equilibrium, is the most com mon way of proceeding in any economic analysis.Do not forget, however, that this pattern of thought is merely an aid to under standing economic theories and principles. It is not the theories and principles themselves. The theories and principles, in turn, are just aids to understanding the reality; they are not themselves the reality.Graphs and EquationsIn the seventeenth century, the French philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes spent much of his life demonstrating that graphs and equations can be thought of as two different ways of representing the same underlying concepts. An algebraic equation relating two variables x and y can also be seen as a curve drawn on a graph where the value of x is marked on the horizontal axis and the value of y is marked on the vertical axis. Thus each of the variables in the equation can be thought of as one of the axes of the graph. The set of points whose x-axis value is the first variable and whose y-axis value is the second — that is, the set of points for which the equation holds — makes up a line or curve on the graph. That line or curve is the equation (see Figure 3.5). Thus the solution to a set of two equa tions is the point on the graph where the two curves that represent the equations intersect. Moreover, you can just as easily move back in the other direction, by thinking of a curve in terms of the equation that generates it. Today economists make very extensive use of these ideas from Descartes’s analytic geometry.Just after the end of World War II Professor Paul Samuelson of MIT discovered that many of his students were much more comfortable manipulating diagrams than solving algebraic equations. With diagrams, they could see what was going on in a hypothetical economy. Thinking of how a particular curve would shift was often easier than thinking of the consequences of changing the value of the con stant term in an equation.When economists translate their algebraic equations into analytical geometric dia grams, they do things that may annoy you. Economists (like mathematicians) thinkanalytic geometryThe idea that graphs and equations are two different ways of expressing the same concepts.FIGURE 3.5Two Forms of the Production Function Economists build their arguments by moving back and forth between equations and diagrams representing the same relationship. The graph on the right is the geometric representation of the algebraic equation on the left.\n",
    "70Chapter 3 Thinking Like an Economistof a “line” as a special kind of “curve” (and it is: It is a curve with zero curva ture). So you may find words — in this book, in your lecture, or in your section — referring to a “Phillips curve,” but when you look at the accompanying diagram, you see that it is a straight line. Do not let this bother you. Economists use the word “curve” to preserve a little generality.If you find analytic geometry easy and intuitive, then Samuelson’s intellectual innovation will make macroeconomics more accessible to you. Behavioral rela tionships become curves that shift about on a graph. Conditions of economic equi librium become dots where curves describing two behavioral relationships cross (and thus both behavioral relationships are satisfied). Changes in the state of the economy become movements of a dot. Understanding economic theories and argu ments becomes as simple as moving lines and curves around on a graph and look ing for the place where the correct two curves intersect. And solving systems of equations becomes easy, as does changing the presuppositions of the problem and noting the results.If you are not comfortable with analytic geometry, then you need to find other tools to help you think like an economist. Remember that the graphs are merely tools to aid your understanding. If they don’t, then you need to concentrate on understanding and manipulating the algebra, or understanding and using the ver bal descriptions of a problem. Use whatever method feels most comfortable. Grab hold of what makes most sense to you, and recognize that all of these approaches are ways of reaching the same conclusions.RECAP PATTERNS OF ECONOMISTS' THOUGHTThree concepts in addition to the circular flow dominate the patterns of econ omists’ thoughts. Understand these three concepts and their role in economic analysis and you will be well on your way to being an economist. The three concepts are markets — where trades take place; equilibrium — points where economic forces are in balance; and mathematical expression through graphs and equations.3.4 MODEL BUILDINGEconomists use their graphs and equations to build their mathematical models. The first thing to remember about their models is that they are simple: Simplification is at the core of economists’ model building. Economists build simple models for two reasons. First, no one really understands excessively complicated models. A model is of little use if economists cannot understand the logic behind its prediction. Sec ond, the predictions generated by simple models are nearly as good as the ones gen erated by more complex models. While the economic models used by the Federal Reserve or the Congressional Budget Office are more complicated than the models presented in this textbook, in essence they are cousins of the models used here.You may have heard that economics is more of an art than a science. This means that the rules for effective and useful model building — for omitting unnecessary detail and complexity while retaining the necessary and important relationships — are nowhere written down. In this important respect, economists tend to learn by\n",
    "3.4 Model Building71doing or by example. But almost every successful construction of a macroeconomic model follows certain fundamental steps. These include the use of representative agents, a focus on opportunity costs in understanding agents’ decisions, and care ful attention to the effect of people’s expectations on events.Representative AgentsOne simplification that macroeconomists, but not microeconomists, invoke constantly is that all participants in the economy are the same or, rather, that the differences between businesses and workers do not matter much for the issues macroeconomists study. Thus macroeconomists analyze a situation by examining the decision making of a single representative agent — be it a business, a worker, or a saver. They then generalize to the economy as a whole from what would be the rational decisions of that single representative agent.The use of representative agents makes macroeconomics simpler, yet it also makes some questions very hard to analyze. Consider unemployment: The key concept is that some workers have jobs but others do not. If one has adopted the simplifying assumption of a single representative worker, how can one worker represent both those who are employed and those who are not?The assumption of a representative agent is also useless when the relative dis tribution of income and wealth among people in the economy is the important question. Consider an economy in which everyone works equally hard, but 1 mil lion lucky people receive \\$10,000,000 a year in income and 99 million receive \\$10,000 a year in income. Now consider an economy in which all 100 million people work equally hard and each receives \\$80,000 a year in income. Almost all of us would think that the second was a happier and fairer economy, even though total income in the first economy amounts to \\$10.99 trillion and total income in the second economy amounts to only \\$8 trillion. As noted earlier, every discipline sees some things clearly and some things fuzzily. Distribution and its impact on social welfare are an area that macroeconomics has trouble bringing into focus.representative agentsA simplification often made in macroeconomics that assumes all participants in the economy are the same.Opportunity CostPerhaps the most fundamental principle that economists use in modeling the decisions individuals make is the principle that there is always a choice. You could always have chosen to do something else. And the very act of making a choice excludes your ability to have done its alternatives instead: It forecloses your opportunities.If you keep your wealth in the form of easily spendable cash, you pass up the chance to keep it earning interest in the form of bonds. If you keep your wealth in the form of interest-earning bonds, you pass up the capability of immediately spending it on something that suddenly strikes your fancy. If you spend it on con sumption goods, you pass up the opportunity to save. Economists use the term opportunity cost to refer to the value of the best alternative that you forgo in mak ing any particular choice.At the root of every behavioral relationship is somebody’s decision. In analyz ing such decisions, economists always think about the decision maker’s opportu nity costs. What else could the decision maker do? What opportunities and choices does the decision maker foreclose by taking one particular course of action? Manyopportunity costThe next best opportunity forgone in order to do something else.\n",
    "72Chapter 3 Thinking Like an Economiststudents make economics a lot harder than it has to be by not remembering that this opportunity-cost way of thinking is at the heart of every behavioral relation ship in an economic model.The Focus on ExpectationsMany times the opportunity cost of taking some action today is not an alternative use of the same resources today but a forgone opportunity to save one’s resources for the future. A worker trying to decide whether to quit a job and search for another will be thinking about future wages after a successful search. A consumer trying to decide whether to spend or save will be thinking about what interest rate savings will earn in the future.No one, however, knows the future. At best people can form rational and rea sonable expectations of what the future might be. Hence nearly every behavioral relationship in macroeconomic models depends on expectations of the future. Expectations formation is a central, perhaps the central, piece of macroeconomics. Every macroeconomic model must explain the amount of time people can spend thinking about the future, the information they have available, and the rules of thumb they use to turn information into expectations.As we will see in Chapter 12, economists tend to consider three types of expec tations:• Static expectations, in which decision makers simply don’t think about the future.• Adaptive expectations, in which decision makers assume that the future is going to be like the recent past.• Rational expectations, in which decision makers spend as much time as they can thinking about the future and know as much (or more) about the struc ture and behavior of the economy as the model builder does.The behavior of an economic model will differ profoundly depending on what kind of expectations economists build into the model.Solving Economic Models: Behavioral Relationships and Equilibrium ConditionsWhen economists are trying to analyze the implications of how people act — say, how the overall level of production would change with a larger capital stock — they almost always write an equation that represents a behavioral relationship. This behavioral relationship states how the effect (the total level of production) is related to the cause (the available capital stock). The economist usually draws a diagram to help visualize the relationship and writes it down verbally. For exam ple, an economist trying to relate an economy’s productive resources to the level of economic output would reason: “A larger capital stock means that the average employee will have more machines and equipment to work with, and this will increase total production per worker. But increases in capital will probably be sub ject to diminishing returns, so the gain in production from increasing the capital stock per worker from \\$40,000 to \\$80,000 will be less than the gain in produc tion from increasing the capital stock per worker from \\$0 to \\$40,000.” Box 3.3 fleshes out this example of a behavioral relationship — in this case, the production function. This particular behavioral relationship, the production function, is a very important part of the next chapter."

However, the speed of short-run growth appears to have peaked in major economies, and the major economies are less likely to grow together. In emerging-market and developing economies prospects are also diverging, with increases in the price of oil, increasing fear of higher tariffs, increasing interest rates in the United States, and worries aboutr what increasing rates will do to the values of currencies and thus the burden of international debt in countries currently borrowing from abroad. Turkey is in the most serious trouble of major developing and emerging-market economies, with prospects in Argentina, Brazil, and India deteriorating as they go on to the watchoist.\n",

    "Both recently announced and widely-anticipated increases in trade tariffs by the United States with the very high likelihood of retaliatory tariff increases by its affected trading partners could derail global economic recovery and might well reduce prospects for medium-term growth. They will have a direct impact reducing productivity. They will have an indirect impact by raising uncertainty, and thus inducing a postponement of investment until uncertainty is resolved. \n",

    "Interest rates in the Global North advanced economies remain exceptionally low and thus stimulative for investment, especially risky investment.

Substantial fiscal stimulus together with already-robust private final demand will lift output further above potential and lower the unemployment rate below levels last registered 50 years ago, creating additional inflationary pressures.

In June, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC oil producers agreed to raise oil production by about 1 million barrels per day from current levels, correcting the recent undershooting of the November 2016 group target. Market expectations suggest that declining capacity in Venezuela and US sanctions on Iran may pose difficulties for the group to deliver the agreed upon production increase consistently. Futures markets, however, indicate prices are likely to decline over the next 4–5 years (in part due to increased US shale production)—as of end-June, medium-term futures prices are about $59 per barrel (20 percent below current levels). The increase in fuel prices has lifted headline inflation in advanced and emerging market economies. Core inflation has strengthened in the United States as the labor market has tightened further, \n",

    "\n",
    "As of the end of 2004, the U.S. macroeconomy was enjoying a moderately strong but uneven recovery. The collapse of the dot-com stock market bubble in 2000 and the September 11, 2001, terrorist destruction of the World Trade Center and attack on the Pentagon triggered a decline in economic activity — a recession — as businesses that were more pessimistic about the prospect of future profits and scared of the uncertainty produced by terrorism cut back their investment spend  ing, and production and employment fell. Between the beginning of the reces  sion and the end of 2001, the U.S. economy lost 0.9 million jobs. In response to these adverse shocks, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates far and fast to try to encourage businesses to invest more: The three-month money-market nom  inal interest rate that had been 6.74 percent per year in the summer of 2000 had been cut to 1.75 percent per year by the late fall of 2001 and to 1 percent by the middle of 2003. And the Bush tax cuts directed more money into the hands of con  sumers, who increased their spending, which reduced the magnitude of the reces  sion’s spending shortfall.\n",
    "Thus slowly in 2002 and more rapidly in 2003, the economy began to recover. Demand and production began to grow again. However, demand and production growth in 2003 and 2004 was, in everyone’s estimation, insufficient. Because of rapid underlying productivity growth in the American economy, the renewed economic expansion did little to expand employment. With a relatively disappointing job market, wages did not rise by much. The recovery of 2003 and 2004 did enormous amounts to boost productivity and profits, substantial amounts to boost produc  tion, but little to boost employment or wages.\n",
    "By the end of 2004 there were renewed worries among economists. One set of worries was that the United States could not afford the large tax cuts of the Bush administration — that they would produce very large budget deficits that would retard economic growth in the future. The Bush tax cuts, in combination with the extra defense spending authorized after September 11, eliminated the government budget surplus that had been painfully created during the 1990s. Given our low\n",
    " private saving rate, the elimination of public saving was likely in the medium run to reduce investment, and thus to slow growth. And the tax cuts were not designed in a way that would produce many significant supply-side production benefits. The principal long-run impact of the tax cuts would be a further reduction in America’s already low national saving rate and a slowing of economic growth.\n",
    "Moreover, by the end of 2004 there were worries that a forthcoming sharp decline in the value of the dollar would provide a further adverse and contrac  tionary shock to the United States and to the world economy. Should foreign exchange speculators lose confidence in the dollar, the value of foreign currency could rise far and fast, possibly causing macroeconomic problems. Economists are very good at pointing out economic situations that are inconsistent with funda  mental values — policies, imbalances, or balance sheet problems that cannot possi  bly last and are bound to end, perhaps in a crisis. But they are bad at forecasting when and how such imbalances will end.\n",
    "The recession of 2001 had been preceded by a remarkable decade-long economic boom. Policy makers and economists advocating the Clinton administration’s eco  nomic programs — deficit reduction and the lowering of trade barriers — had done so in the interest of accelerating long-run growth. Reduced trade barriers would allow for closer international integration, a finer international division of labor, and increased productivity. Deficit reduction would make possible high-investment eco  nomic expansion, which would then become high-productivity growth expansion.\n",
    "Until 1996 there were few signs that high investment was leading to high productivity growth, but then the pace of economic growth exploded. Perhaps the political claims in the early 1990s that deficit reduction would ignite a high-investment and high-productivity growth recovery were coming true. Perhaps the U.S. econ  omy was simply benefiting from the sudden wave of rapid productivity growth driven by the technological revolutions in data processing and data communications. The most likely possibility was and is that both were true. This was confirmed by the continuation of rapid growth in American labor productivity through the recession of 2001 and into the recovery that followed. The “new economy” of the 1990s that optimists had seen as the result of technological revolutions in information technol  ogy was indeed a reality, and the principal beneficiaries were consumers who found themselves able to buy at low prices and businesses that found that computerization greatly increased productivity.\n",

    "In the early 2000s 11 western European countries adopted the euro as their com  mon currency. The adoption of the euro was followed not by strong growth, but by stagnation and recession. European unemployment rates mounted toward 10 per  cent between 2000 and 2004, and real GDP growth for the euro zone was rarely above 2 percent per year. There was certainly room for economic expansion in Europe: Consumer prices were rising at less than 2 percent per year. The challenge for European economic policy remains one of avoiding rises in inflation while attempting to reduce western Europe’s distressingly high and stubborn rate of unemployment, yet interpreting the European Central Bank’s actions as part of any policy intended to try to meet that challenge remains difficult.\n",
    "However, for the first time in decades Europeans were hopeful that the next decade would bring a reduction, not an increase, in unemployment. Changes in policy are making the European labor market more flexible and in the long run should make it easier for firms to change the number of workers they employ, which should make it easier for workers to find jobs and thus lower unemploy  ment. Most of western Europe is perhaps half a decade behind the United States in its adoption of data processing and data communications technology Thus there is good reason to hope that the information-technology-driven productivity growth acceleration experienced by the United States in the late 1990s should be visible in western Europe in the late 2000s.\n",
    "And in eastern Europe, economies continue to grow, as the long and slow process of “transition” away from communism has continued."

Japan was still undergoing deflation, with consumer prices expected to fall by 1.0 percent in the next year.\n",
    "Fortunately, Japan was no longer in recession: The country had experienced six straight quarters of positive growth in real GDP. Although unemployment in Japan remained above 5 percent — an astonishingly high level for Japan — it was no longer increasing. There was good reason to believe that Japan’s decade-long expe  rience with stagnation and recession was over, and that Japanese economic growth had resumed.\n",
    "The start of the 1990s saw the collapse of the Japanese stock and real estate markets, the end of the so-called bubble economy. The 1990s as a whole saw the breakdown of the Japanese model of economic growth, as the economy stagnated for much of the decade. Now there is a general recognition that Japan faces a structural economic crisis. But there is no political consensus as to what is to be done, and the major political steps that need to be taken to restore growth — restructuring the Japanese financial system and deregulating transportation and distribution — have been long delayed.\n",
    "The Bank of Japan is now pursuing a policy of making short-term safe nominal interest rates as close to zero as it can. But what matters for investment spending is not a low short-term safe nominal interest rate but a low long-term risky real interest rate, and that will remain high as long as bond traders fear that (1) the low-interest rate policy may be temporary, (2) many companies may go bankrupt and never repay the money they borrow, and (3) prices may decline more rapidly, turning low nominal interest rates into high inflation-adjusted real interest rates. For most of the 1990s and into the early 2000s, even interest rates near zero proved insufficient to boost investment."

Market expectations suggest that declining capacity in Venezuela and US sanctions on Iran may pose difficulties for the group to deliver the agreed upon production increase consistently. Futures markets, however, indicate prices are likely to decline over the next 4–5 years (in part due to increased US shale production)—as of end-June, medium-term futures prices are about $59 per barrel (20 percent below current levels). The increase in fuel prices has lifted headline inflation in advanced and emerging market economies. \n",

    "Financial conditions in emerging markets. Central banks in key emerging market economies —including Argentina, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey—have raised policy rates, responding to inflation and exchange rate pressures (coupled with capital flow reversals in some cases). Long-term yields have also increased in recent months, and spreads have generally widened. Most emerging market equity indices have declined modestly, reflecting, in some cases, concerns about imbalances (e.g., Argentina and Turkey), and, more generally, rising downside risks to the outlook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, some emerging market currencies have depreciated sharply. The Argentine peso has weakened by over 20 percent and the Turkish lira by around 10 percent, due to concerns about financial and macroeconomic imbalances. The Brazilian real has depreciated by over 10 percent on a weaker-than-expected recovery and political uncertainty. Weaker-than-anticipated macroeconomic data for South Africa contributed to the 7 percent depreciation \n",

    "Emerging market and developing economies have experienced powerful crosswinds in recent months: rising oil prices, higher yields in the United States, dollar appreciation, trade tensions, and geopolitical conflict. The outlook for regions and individual economies thus varies depending on how these global forces interact with domestic idiosyncratic factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emerging and Developing Asia is expected to maintain its robust and anticipated trade measures1 are expected to be small, as these measures affect only a very small share of global trade so far. The baseline forecast also assumes limited spillovers to market sentiment, even if escalating trade tensions are an important downside risk.\n",

    "Oil exporters in the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan region have benefited from the improved outlook for oil prices, but the outlook for oil importing countries remains fragile. Several economies still face large fiscal consolidation needs and the threat of intensifying geopolitical conflict continues to weigh on growth in the region. Growth is projected to strengthen from 2.2 percent in 2017 to 3.5 percent in 2018 and further to 3.9 percent in 2019—0.2 percentage point higher than in the April WEO for 2019.\n",

    "Elsewhere in the world, the big economic news is the substantial growth boom in India. Together with China, its population makes up 40 percent of the human race, Its economy was expected to grow at 6 percent in 2005. India’s boom is driven by investment for the internal market and by growing exports of business and other services to the world’s industrial core. \n",

    "As of the end of 2004, the financial crisis in East Asia of the past decade was only a distant memory. The panic that started in 1997 on the part of investors in New York, Frankfurt, London, and Tokyo, and the consequent withdrawal of their money from emerging market economies, imposed very high costs: mas  sive bankruptcies, high interest rates, increases in unemployment, falls in pro  duction. But foreign investors appear to have regained confidence in East Asian economies.\n",
    "However, the destabilizing factors in the world economy that made for the East Asian crisis of 1997-1998 are still present, as can be seen by the crash of the Argentinean economy at the end of 2001. Many argued that a critical cause of the East Asian crisis and, before it, the Mexican financial crisis was that the govern  ments retained the ability to devalue and depreciate the currency and that that was a key source of the capital flight that rippled through their economies and set off the crises. Argentina, however, handed authority over its exchange rate to an independent organization — a “currency board.” Yet that did not help. When in 2001 investors in New York, Frankfurt, London, Tokyo, and elsewhere became worried that the Argentine government’s failure to balance its budget heralded a future of more rapid money printing and inflation, the same factors came into play. And the fact of Argentina’s currency board only meant that the crisis became more convoluted and difficult to resolve — it was still not resolved three years after its beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elsewhere in Latin America as of 2005 growth continued to be positive, but disappointing. The Mexican government continued to wrestle with the problem of fixing its still-insolvent banking system. Brazil struggled under the burden of its large national debt and attempted to fulfill the hopes of growth with equity raised by the election of left-of-center president Luis Ignacio da Silva.\n",
    "The most disappointing areas of the world as far as economic growth was con  cerned continued to be the Middle East and Africa."

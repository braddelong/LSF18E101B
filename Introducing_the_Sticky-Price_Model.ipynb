    "## Part IV Sticky Price Macroeconomics\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapters 4 through 8 do not give a complete picture of the macroeconomy. In Chapters 4 through 8, growth is smooth from year to year. But in the real world growth is not. In Chapters 4 through 8, supply and demand in the labor market are always in balance. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in the real world the labor market is not always in equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand these business-cycle fluctuations in economic growth and unemployment, we need a model that does not require that employment be full and real GDP be equal to potential output. The full-employment model of Part 3 is not of help because its flexible-price assumption guarantees full employment. Here in Part 4, therefore, we need to break this flexible-price assumption to build a useful model of the business cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point forward, prices, wages, and debts will be \"sticky\": They will not move freely and instan­ taneously in response to changes in demand and supply. We will use this sticky-price model to account for business-cycle fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building this sticky-price model of the macroeconomy is the task of Part 4. Chapter 9 focuses on how, when, prices are sticky, the inventory adjustment process is the key to understanding how GDP can fall below or rise above potential output. Chapter 10 analyzes how changes in the interest rate affect investment, exports, and GDP. Chapter 11 focuses on equilibrium in the money market and the balance of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Chapter 12 focuses on monetary policy, expectations, and inflation. It links the sticky-price model of Part 4 back to the flexible-price model of Part 3 by analyzing which model is most useful in which sets of circumstances.\n",

    "## The Sticky-Price Income-Expenditure Framework: Consumption and the Multiplier\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUESTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are \"sticky\" prices?\n",
    "2. What factors might make prices sticky in the short run?\n",
    "3. In the short run when prices are sticky, what determines the level of real GDP?\n",
    "4. When prices are sticky, what happens to real GDP if some component of planned total expenditure rises or falls?\n",
    "5. What is the spending multiplier? What factors determine its size?\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade real GDP in the American economy has grown at an aver­ age rate of 3.3 percent per year. At the same time, the American unemployment rate has fluctuated around an average level consistent with stable inflation — a natural rate o f unemployment — of roughly 5.0 percent.1 During the past decade, the inflation rate in the United States has been low: an average of about 1.8 per­ cent per year as measured by the price index associated with GDP, the GDP deflator.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Chapters 4 through 8 gave a complete picture of the macroeconomy, this economic growth would have been smooth. Real GDP would have grown 3.4 percent — the CBO’s estimate of the current rate of growth of potential GDP — year after year, not just on average. The unemployment rate would have remained steady at its natural rate of approximately 5.0 percent. And inflation would have been steady as well, determined by the rates of growth of potential output and the money stock and the velocity of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if this were the case, the analysis in Chapters 4 and 5 would provide a complete picture of how potential output grew over time. The analysis in Chap­ ters 6 and 7 would explain why real GDP equals potential output and how national income is divided among the different components of total expenditure. The analy­ sis in Chapter 8 would detail how the price level and the inflation rate are deter­ mined. It would be the last chapter in this textbook. Your survey of macroeconomics would be finished now.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it isn’t. This is not the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chapters 4 through 8 do not give a complete picture of the macroeconomy. Growth is not at all smooth; on a year-to-year time scale, it is not even guaranteed. In 1982 real GDP was not 3.4 percent more but 1.9 percent less than it was in 1981 (see Figure 9.1). Between 1979 and 1982 the unemployment rate rose by 3.9 percentage points, and it rose again by 2.2 percentage points between 1989 and 1992. Unemployment may have been only 4 percent at the end of 2000, but it was 7.6 percent in the middle of 1992. Inflation at the end of 2000 may have been only 2.2 percent per year, but in 1981 it was 9.4 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "These fluctuations are called business cycles. A business cycle has two phases: an expansion or boom phase as production, employment, and prices all grow rap­ idly, and a subsequent recession or depression phase during which inflation falls or prices slump, unemployment rises, and production falls. During booms, output grows faster than trend, investment spending amounts to a higher-than-average share of GDP, unemployment falls, and inflation usually accelerates. During recessions, output falls, investment spending is a low share of real GDP, unemployment rises, and inflation usually decelerates. Compared to the overall upward trend of long- run growth, these short-run fluctuations (with the exception of the Great Depres­ sion) appear relatively small. But, as we noted in Chapter 1, they have a large impact on the lives of those unlucky enough to lose their jobs or to fail to find jobs when a recession hits.\n",

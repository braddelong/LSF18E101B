    "The Solow Growth Model is the simplest possible model capable of capturing anything about economic growth that I am aware of. It has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a capital stock K, determined over time by the savings-investment share s, output Y, and a depreciation rate &delta;.\n",
    "* a labor force L, determined over time by its growth rate n.\n",
    "* an efficiency-of-labor E, determined over time by its growth rate g.\n",
    "* a production function determining output Y, depending on a parameter &alpha; capturing the relative capital orientation of growth as well as on K, L, and E.\n",
    "* That's it!\n",

    "What can we then tell about economic growth from this very simple framework?    \n",

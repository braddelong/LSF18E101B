    "Chapters 4 through 8 do not give a complete picture of the macroeconomy. In Chapters 4 through 8, growth is smooth from year to year. But in the real world growth is not. In Chapters 4 through 8, supply and demand in the labor market are always in balance. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in the real world the labor market is not always in equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand these business-cycle fluctuations in economic growth and unemployment, we need a model that does not require that employment be full and real GDP be equal to potential output. The full-employment model of Part 3 is not of help because its flexible-price assumption guarantees full employment. Here in Part 4, therefore, we need to break this flexible-price assumption to build a useful model of the business cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point forward, prices, wages, and debts will be \"sticky\": They will not move freely and instantaneously in response to changes in demand and supply. We will use this sticky-price model to account for business-cycle fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building this sticky-price model of the macroeconomy is the task of Part 4. Chapter 9 focuses on how, when, prices are sticky, the inventory adjustment process is the key to understanding how GDP can fall below or rise above potential output. Chapter 10 analyzes how changes in the interest rate affect investment, exports, and GDP. Chapter 11 focuses on equilibrium in the money market and the balance of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Chapter 12 focuses on monetary policy, expectations, and inflation. It links the sticky-price model of Part 4 back to the flexible-price model of Part 3 by analyzing which model is most useful in which sets of circumstances.\n",

    "Over the past two-and-a-half decades, real GDP in the American economy has nearly doubled in size: the inflation-adjusted measured production of useful marketable goods and services has grown at an average rate of 2.51 percent per year. Growth has not been smooth and even. From 1993 to 2000, on President Clinton's watch, the economy-as-measured grew at 3.85% per year. From 2000 to 2007, on President Bush's watch but before the catastrophe of 2008, the economy-as-measured grew at a rate of 2.40 percent per year. In 2008 and 2009 the economy collapsed: it shrank by 3.7 percent. And from 2009 to the third quarter of 2018 the economy-as-measured has grown at 2.29 percent per year.\n",

    "Over this same 25-year period, the unemployment rate has varied widely and wildly as well. In September 1993 it was 6.7 percent: civilians who said that they were looking for a job but could not (yet) find one amounted to 6.7 percent of the total of all those who reported that they had jobs or were looking for jobs. By April 2000 this civilian unemployment rate was 3.8 percent. June 2003 saw it up to 6.3 percent. May 2007 saw it down to 4.4 percent. In October 2009 it was at a catastrophic 10.0 percent—although that was much lower than the truly horrific 23 percent unemployment rate of the Great Depression back in 1993.

Before 1993 interpreting the non-employment rate as an indicator of whether production is near to or well below potential output is made difficult by the sociological changes that are the rise of feminism. Since 1993 the share of men and women together who wish to hold paid jobs has, adjusted for the business cycle, been constant. \n",

And it is not the case that production and employment have been artificially and unsustainably elevated above sustainable levels on average due to some outbreak of inflationary and devaluationary policies: the inflation rate excluding volatile food and energy prices—the so-called \"core\" inflation rate—for the Consumer Price Index or CPI was 3.3 percent in 1993; it is 2.2 percent today.\n",

At most, there might have been speed-ups or slow-downs as changes in the savings-investment rate, in investment requirements, or in the rate of efficiency-of-labor growth caused the long-run balanced-growth path to shift. But there would have been no jumps and no rapid accelerations or decelerations: convergence to the balanced-growth path is a generations-long process.

    "\n",
    "#### 9.1.1 Understanding Sticky-Price Business Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand business cycles, we need a model that does not guarantee full employment and in which real GDP does not always equal potential output. Business cycles are not fluctuations in potential output. They are fluctuations of actual production around potential output — above potential output when the economy is “overheated,” and below potential output when the economy possesses substantial “slack.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the full-employment model of Chapters 6 and 7 is of no help here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its assumption that prices are flexible guarantees full employment leads us down the wrong road. The flexible-price assumption allowed us to start our analysis in a simple and straightforward way, by noting that _if_ the labor market would clear, _then_ as a result firms would fully employ workers who wanted to work, and _thus_ that real GDP and household income would be equal to potential output and both would be equal to aggregate demand because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the real wage W/P adjusts to balance demand and supply for labor at full employment\n",
    "2. the price level P adusts to keep aggregate demand—total spending—equal to the amount needed to purchase the full-employment value of production\n",
    "3. the long-term real risky interest rate r adjusts to balance supply and demand in the flow-of-funds through financial markets, and so match the components of aggregate demand—household consumption spending C, business investment spending I, government purchases G, and net exports NX—so that their sum adds up to aggregate demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexprice analysis is an analysis filled with \"ifs\" that are not so: they are useful for clarifying thought and for setting a baseline to which we can compare the behavior of actual economies, not for understanding why actual economies undergo the business cycle fluctuations that they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Moreover, the flexible-price assumption may not be a terrible one to make for purposes of empirical analysis if employment is and remains nearly full. Perhaps it does so because there have been no large disturbances to demand in a while, so that wages and prices in labor and product markets have had time to adjust. Perhaps it does so because the Federal Reserve has done a good job of neutralizing disturbances to aggregate demand.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But we cannot afford to keep the flexible-price assumption if we wish to make any further progress. We need to break it if we are to build a more useful model of the business cycle. Thus from this point on wages and prices will be “sticky”: They will not move freely and instantaneously in response to changes in demand and supply. Instead, prices will remain fixed at predetermined levels as businesses expand or contract production in response to changes in demand and costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, such sticky prices make a big difference in economic analysis; they will drive a wedge between real GDP and poten­ tial output and between the supply of workers and the demand for labor. We will then be able to use this sticky-price model to account for business-cycle fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building this sticky-price model of the macroeconomy will take up all of Part 4. In this chapter, we will focus on how, when prices are sticky, firms hire or fire workers and expand or cut back production on the basis of whether their inventories are falling or rising. Inventory adjustment is the key to understanding how the level of real GDP can fluctuate around potential output. Chapter 10 focuses on how changes in the interest rate affect the levels of investment, exports, and real GDP in the sticky-price model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 11 takes a deeper look at equilibrium in the money market: How are interest rates in the short run really determined? It is an optional chapter. You can simply say that the Federal Reserve—the Fed—sets interest rates, not inquire into how, and skip Chapter 11. But if you want to understand what happens when there is no interest rate-pegging central bank around, or how the Federal Reserve pegs interest rates, or what happens if the Federal Reserve pegs not interest rates but the money stock, then you need to study Chapter 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last chapter of Part 4, Chapter 12, takes up the topics of expectations and inflation in an environment in which the Fed sets interest rates. By the end of Chapter 12 we will have linked up the sticky-price model of Part 4 with the flexible-price model of Part 3. We will understand the sorts of situations for which the sticky-price model is appropriate. And we will understand under what sets of circumstances wages and prices are flexible enough and have enough time to adjust for the flexible- price model to be the most useful way of analyzing the macroeconomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each stage in the building of our sticky-price macroeconomic model, the preceding topic serves as a necessary foundation. The analysis of inflation and expectations in Chapter 12 rests on the analysis of how changes in interest rates affect investment, exports, and real GDP in Chapter 10. And the analysis of Chapter 10 in turn rests on the analysis of income, expenditure, and equilibrium in a sticky- price economy carried out here in Chapter 9. Chapter 11 also rests on Chapters 9 and 10, and it provides a fuller foundation for Chapter 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, this book has not been cumulative. You could understand the long-run growth analysis in Chapters 4 and 5 without a firm grasp of the introductory material in Chapters 1 through 3. You could understand the flexible-price analysis in Chapters 6 and 7 without a firm grasp of either the introductory or the long-run-growth chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "But from this point on, the chapters of this book become interdependent and very cumulative indeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1.2 Consequences of Flexible and Sticky Prices: Flexprice Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "To preview the difference between the flexible-price and the sticky-price models, let us analyze a decline in consumers’ propensity to spend under both sets of assumptions. Suppose there is a sudden fall in the consumer confidence parameter $ c_o $, the parameter that determines the baseline level of consumption in the consumption function and thus shifts the function up or down on the income-spending graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ C= c_o + c_y{1-t)Y $\n",
    "\n",
    "where Y is GDP or national income, t is the tax rate, C is consumption spending, and $ c_y $ is the marginal propensity to consume parameter of the consumption function that determines captures how much consumption increases for a 1 dollar increase in national income. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concrete, consider what happens when baseline consumption spending falls. Suppose that the function for annual consumption spending (in billions of dollars at an annual rate) is shifted down on the income-spending graph by an amount $ {\\Delta}c_o = 250 $: declines from:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ C = 750 + (0.75){1-t)Y $\n",
    "\n",
    "to:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ C = 500 + (0.75){1-t)Y $\n",
    "\n",
    "In the full-employment model of Chapters 6 and 7, such a 250 billion dollar fall in annual baseline consumption spending would have no impact on the level of real GDP. No matter what the flow of total expenditure, the labor market would still reach its full-employment equilibrium because flexible wages and prices would make it so. And because the economy remains at full employment, real GDP would still equal potential output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fall in consumption spending would have an effect on the economy—just not on the level of real GDP. In the flexprice model a fall in household consumption spending with national and thus household income unchanged is also an increase in private saving $ S^p $. As consumption falls, the total saving curve shifts rightward on the flow-of-funds saving-interest rate diagram. The fall in consumption spending reduces the equilibrium real interest rate. The fall in the interest rate then leads to increases in the equilibrium level of investment and net exports. \n",
    "\n",
    "By how much does investment plus net exports increase? By 250 billion dollars at an annual rate, the amount necessary to offset the fall in consumption spending and keep real GDP equal to potential output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus these are the flexible-price-model consequences of a fall in households’ desired baseline consumption spending:\n",
    "\n",
    "* consumption falling.\n",
    "* household private saving rising.\n",
    "* the real interest rate falling.\n",
    "* real investment rising.\n",
    "* the value of foreign currency rising.\n",
    "* exports rising.\n",
    "\n",
    "These adjustments keep the flow of planned expenditure from changing: flexible wages and prices mean that employment remains at full employment, and the level of real GDP produced remains at potential output.\n",
    " \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1.3 Consequences of Flexible and Sticky Prices: Sticky-Price Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Sticky-price logic is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "If wages and prices are sticky, we have to carry out a different analysis. The first consequence of consumers’ cutting back their spending will be a fall in expenditure for goods—in aggregate demand. Consumer spending is falling, yet nothing has happened or is happening to change the flow of spending on investment goods, the flow of net exports, or the flow of government purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "As businesses see spending on their products begin to fall, they will not cut their nominal prices (remember, prices are sticky). Instead, they will respond to the fall in the quantity of their products demanded by reducing their production. They see their invenstories rising, and they do not want that—they want to avoid accumulating unsold and unsellable inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "As they reduce production, they will fire some of their workers. The incomes of the fired workers will drop, and so national income will start dropping. \n",
    "\n",
    "By how much will total national income drop? Initially, it will fall by the amount of the fall in baseline consumption spending: by 200 billion dollars at an annual rate. And that will have consequences—as we see a bit later on—that will amplify its magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the consequences of a fall in consumption spending under the sticky-price assumption are\n",
    "\n",
    "* consumption falling.\n",
    "* production and employment declining.\n",
    "* national income declining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the flexprice model, when consumption falls, investment and net exports rise. Why doesn’t the same thing happen in the sticky-price model? Why doesn’t a rise in investment spending keep GDP equal to potential output and keep employment full? What goes wrong with the flexprice logic, according to which a fall in consumption spending generates an increase in saving that then boosts both investment spending and net exports?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that in the sticky-price model, firms respond to falling demand not by cutting prices but by cutting back production and employment, and so total income falls. The fall in total income reduces saving just as a fall in consumption raises saving. Under the sticky-price assumption, the effect on total saving of the fall in consumption and the fall in income cancel each other out; there is no change in the flow of saving. Thus there is no rightward shift in the position of the total saving curve on the flow-of-funds saving-interest rate diagram. There is thus no fall in interest rates to trigger higher investment (and a higher value of the exchange rate and expanded net exports). There is nothing to offset the fall in consumption spending and keep GDP from falling below potential output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why doesn’t this sticky-price unemployment-generating logic work when prices are flexible? When flexprice firms see a fall in total spending, they respond not by cutting production and employment but by cutting the prices they charge and the wages they pay. The real incomes households earn thus remain constant, and falling real consumption spending does induce rising real saving. That rising real saving is what induces a falling real interest rate, rising investment spending, increasing value of foreign currency, and rising net exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 9.1.4 Expectations and Price Stickiness\n",
    "\n",
    "If managers, workers, consumers, and investors had time to foresee a fall in consumption and gradually adjust their wages and prices to it in advance, even considerable stickiness in prices would not be a problem. With sufficient advance notice unions and businesses would strike wage bargains, and businesses could adjust their selling prices to make sure demand matched productive capacity. Both the stickiness of prices and the failure to accurately foresee changes far enough ahead to adjust to them in advance are needed if the sticky-price framework is to create business cycles in employment and output like the ones we see.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about this is that the analysis in Part 4 is a short-run analysis, and the analysis in Part 3 is a longer-run analysis—although it is a longer-run business cycle analysis, and thus it is still much shorter in terms of its run than the truly long-run growth economics analysis conducted in Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Part 4 short-run, prices are sticky; shifts in policy or in the economic environment that affect the components of planned total expenditure will affect real GDP and employment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Part 3 business-cycle longer-run, prices are flexible and workers, bosses, and consumers have time to react and adjust to changes in policy or the economic environment. Thus in the long run, such shifts do not affect real GDP or employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need a sticky-price short-run model as well as the longer-run business-cycle flexprice model? Why don’t economists simply say that once wages and prices have fully adjusted (however long that takes), employment will be full and real GDP will be equal to potential output and stop their analyses there? Economists focus on equilibrium, right? And the equilibrium is the one taht the flexprice model reaches, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous and effective criticism of such let’s-look-only-at-the-longer-run when we are analyzing the business cycle was made by John Maynard Keynes in a 1924 book, his _Tract on Monetary Reform_. Criticizing one such long-run-only analysis, Keynes wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the long run [this] is probably true.... But this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. _In the long run we are all dead_. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean will be flat once more...\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is the line that divides the sticky-price short-run from the flexprice business-cycle longer-run? Do we switch from living in the short run of Part 4 to the long run of Part 3 on June 19, 2023? \n",
    "\n",
    "No, we do not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The “business-cycle longer-run” is an analytical construct. It covers circumstances in which enough people have enough time to have seen it coming far enough in advance and have had time to adjust to it—to renegotiate their contracts and change their standard operating procedures accordingly. The length of the business-cycle longer-run, and thus how many of us will be dead before it comes, depends in turn on the degree of price stickiness and the process by which people form their expectations—both hot topics for academic research in modern macroeconomics.\n",

    "Sticky debts...\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1.5 Why Are Prices Sticky\n",
    "\n",
    "Why don’t prices adjust quickly and smoothly to maintain full employment? Why do businesses respond to fluctuations in demand first by hiring or firing workers and accelerating or shutting down their production lines? Why don’t they respond first by raising or lowering their prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists have identified any number of reasons that prices could be sticky, but they are uncertain which are most important. Some likely explanations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Managers and workers find that changing prices or renegotiating wages is\n",
    "costly and hence best delayed as long as possible.\n",
    "2. The level of prices is as much a sociological as an economic variable—determined as much by what levels people think are “fair” as by the balance of supply and demand. \n",
    "3. Closely related: sorkers take a cut in their wages as an indication that their employer does not value them; hence managers avoid wage cuts because they fear the consequences for worker morale. Managers would rather fire 10 percent of their workers than attempt to impose a 10 percent wage cut on their current workforce because the second would have a catastrophic effect on worker morale, while the first is more likely to make workers work harder out of fear of behing the next ones laid off.\n",
    "4. Managers and workers suffer from simple “money illusion”; they overlook the effect of price-level changes when assessing the impact of changes in wages or prices on their real income or sales.\n",
    "5. Managers and workers lack information and so confuse changes in total economy-wide spending with changes in demand for their specific products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look more closely at each of these likely explanations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Economists call the costs associated with changing prices _menu costs_, a shorthand reference to the fact that when a restaurant changes its prices, it must print up a new menu. In general, changing prices or wages may be costly for any of a large number of reasons. Perhaps people want to stabilize their commercial relationships by signing long-term contracts. Perhaps reprinting a catalog is expensive. Perhaps customers find frequent price changes annoying. Perhaps other firms are not changing their prices and what matters most to a firm is its price relative to the prices of competitors. Hence managers and workers prefer to keep their prices and wages stable as long as the shocks that affect the economy are relatively small—or, rather, as long as the change they might want to make in their prices and wages is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet a third reason why prices and wages are sticky is that workers and managers are really not the flinty-eyed rational maximizers of economic theories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related and fourth, in real life, work effort and work intensity depend on whether workers believe they are being treated fairly. A cut in nominal wages is almost universally perceived as unfair; wages depend on social norms that evolve slowly. Thus wages are by nature sticky. And if wages are sticky, firms will find that their best response to shifts in demand is to hire and fire workers rather than to change prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, workers, consumers, and managers suffer from money illusion: They confuse changes in nominal prices with changes in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) prices. Firms react to higher nominal prices by thinking falsely that it is more profitable to produce more — even though it isn’t because their costs have risen in proportion. Workers react to higher nominal wages by searching more intensively for jobs and working more overtime hours, even though rises in prices have erased any increase in the real purchasing power of the wage paid for an hour’s work. Such money illu­ sion is a powerful generator of price stickiness and business-cycle fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final possible source of price stickiness is imperfect information: a misperception of real and nominal price changes. If managers and workers lack full information about the state of the economy, they may be unsure whether a change in the flow of spending on their products reflects a change in overall aggregate demand or a change in demand for their particular products. If it is the latter, they should respond by changing how much they produce, not necessarily by changing the price. If it is the former, they should respond by changing their price in accord with overall inflation, not by changing how much they produce. If managers are uncertain which it is, they will split the difference. Hence firms will lower their prices less in response to a downward shift in total nominal demand than the flexible-price macroeconomic model would predict. If they keep their prices too high, they will have to fire workers and cut back production. Imperfect information is a possible source of sticky prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these factors are potential sources of price stickiness. Your professor may have strong views about which is most important. We find ourselves more confused and agnostic. Our reading is that economists’ knowledge is more limited. We are not sure the evidence is strong enough to provide clear and convincing support for any particular single explanation as the most important one. A safer position is to remain agnostic about the causes of sticky wages and prices, and so we focus on analyzing not their causes but their effects.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 9.1 RECAP: Sticky Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "The full-employment model of Chapters 6 and 7 does not help explain business cycles. Its assumption that prices and wages are flexible guarantees that real GDP is always equal to potential output. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build a more useful model of the business cycle, we need to assume that prices are sticky. If prices are sticky, the first consequence of ashock like consumers cutting back their spending will be a reduction in production, not a cut in prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prices might be sticky for a number of reasons: menu costs, Imperfect information, concerns of fairness, or simply money illusion. All seem plausible. No one explanation indisputably dominates allthe others.\n",

    "\n",
    "If prices are sticky, higher planned expenditure boosts production, and this boosts income. Higher income gives a further boost to consumption, and this in turn boosts planned expenditure some more. Thus any shift in a component of planned expenditure upward or downward leads to an amplified shift in total production because of the induced shift in consumption, as Figure 9.5 shows. The early-twentieth-century British economist John Maynard Keynes was one of the first to stress the importance of this multiplier process.\n",
    "Whereas in booms the multiplier process induces an upward spiral in production, in bad times it is a source of misery. The downward shock is amplified as those who have been thrown out of work cut back on their consumption spending in turn.\n",
    "Because consumption spending is more than two-thirds of planned expenditure, this multiplier effect can be significant because the positive-feedback loop is so large — if the tax system has not been designed to provide the economy with so- called “automatic stabilizers,” and if the government does not take active steps to cushion the effects of shocks to planned expenditure.\n",

We will use a bottom-up approach, building planned total expenditure PE on domestically produced products up from the determinants of each of its compo­ nents, consumption spending C, investment spending I, government purchases G, and net exports NX.

    "The two-thirds of GDP that is consumption spending is spending by households on things they bnd useful: services such as haircuts, nondurable goods such as food, and durable goods such as washing machines. As Figure 9.6 shows, when income rises consumption spending rises with it, increasing planned total expen­ diture and setting the multiplier process in motion. As we saw in Chapter 6, con­ sumption spending does not rise dollar for dollar with total income. Economists call the share of an extra dollar of disposable income that is added to consump­ tion spending the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is the parame­ ter Cy in the consumption function equation that we saw in Chapter 6:\n",

    "If changes in income are considered permanent, the MPC will be high: A $1 increase in income will lead to an increase in consumption of as much as 80 cents. But if changes in income are considered transitory, the MPC will be low: A $1 increase in income will lead to an increase in consumption of only 30 cents or so. Transitory increases in income have only a small effect on consumption because as we discussed in Appendix 6a people seek to smooth out their consumption spending over time.\n",
    "For reasonably long-lasting shifts in the level of income, the MPC is roughly 0.6. That is, 60 cents of every extra dollar of disposable income shows up as higher consumption. Figure 9.7 shows how we get from the total flow of GDP down to the flow of consumption spending, which is GDP’s largest component.\n",

In the sec­ ond case, in which planned expenditure exceeds production, inventories are falling rapidly Businesses are selling more than they are making. Some businesses will respond to the fall in inventories by boosting prices, trying to earn more profit per good sold. But the bulk of businesses will respond to the fall in inventories by expanding production to match planned expenditure. They are about to hire more workers. Real GDP and national income are about to expand.\n",

Will such an increase bring the economy into goods market equilibrium, with planned expenditure equal to total income and real GDP? The answer is that it will not.

Thus the increase in pro­ duction and income generates a further expansion in planned expenditure.\n",

Businesses do not like to lose money by producing things that they cannot sell or by not having things on hand that they could sell. But it takes at least months, usually quarters, and possibly more time for businesses to expand or cut back production.\n",
    "For example, between the summer of 1990 and the summer of 1991 inven­ tories fell for five straight quarters. Real GDP was less than planned expenditure as businesses decided that their high levels of inventories were too large given the economic uncertainties created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent recession. Between the winter of 1994 and the summer of 1995, for six quarters, inventories rose. For a year and a half GDP was greater than planned expenditure. (See Figure 9.15.)\n",

First, the attack shook consumer confidence: The Conference Board’s index fell from 114 in August 2001 to 85 in November.

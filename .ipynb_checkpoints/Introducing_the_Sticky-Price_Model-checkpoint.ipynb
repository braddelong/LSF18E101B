In September 1993 it was 6.7 percent: civilians who said that they were looking for a job but could not (yet) find one amounted to 6.7 percent of the total of all those who reported that they had jobs or were looking for jobs. By April 2000 this civilian unemployment rate was 3.8 percent. June 2003 saw it up to 6.3 percent. May 2007 saw it down to 4.4 percent. In October 2009 it was at a catastrophic 10.0 percent—although that was much lower than the truly horrific 23 percent unemployment rate of the Great Depression back in 1993.

And it is not the case that production and employment have been artificially and unsustainably elevated above sustainable levels on average due to some outbreak of inflationary and devaluationary policies: the inflation rate excluding volatile food and energy prices—the so-called \"core\" inflation rate—for the Consumer Price Index or CPI was 3.3 percent in 1993; it is 2.2 percent today.\n",

Economic growth would have been smooth as the economy converged to and then grew along its Solow Growth Model balanced-growth path. At most, there might have been speed-ups or slow-downs as changes in the savings-investment rate, in investment requirements, or in the rate of efficiency-of-labor growth caused the long-run balanced-growth path to shift. But there would have been no jumps and no rapid accelerations or decelerations: convergence to the balanced-growth path is a generations-long process. And there certainly would have been no declines in production, and no elevations of the unemployment rate to double-digit levels.\n",

In a business-cycle expansion or boom. production, employment, and perhaps prices all grow rapidly. In a business-cycle recession or depression, inflation falls or prices slump, unemployment rises, and production falls. During booms, output grows faster than trend and investment spending amounts to a higher-than-average share of GDP as unemployment falls. During recessions, output falls, investment spending is a low share of real GDP, unemployment rises, and inflation usually decelerates. \n",

    "\n",
    "To understand business cycles, we need a model that does not guarantee full employment and in which real GDP does not always equal potential output. Business cycles are not fluctuations in potential output. They are fluctuations of actual production around potential output — above potential output when the economy is “overheated,” and below potential output when the economy possesses substantial “slack.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the full-employment model of Chapters 6 and 7 is of no help here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its assumption that prices are flexible guarantees full employment leads us down the wrong road. The flexible-price assumption allowed us to start our analysis in a simple and straightforward way, by noting that _if_ the labor market would clear, _then_ as a result firms would fully employ workers who wanted to work, and _thus_ that real GDP and household income would be equal to potential output and both would be equal to aggregate demand because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the real wage W/P adjusts to balance demand and supply for labor at full employment\n",
    "2. the price level P adusts to keep aggregate demand—total spending—equal to the amount needed to purchase the full-employment value of production\n",
    "3. the long-term real risky interest rate r adjusts to balance supply and demand in the flow-of-funds through financial markets, and so match the components of aggregate demand—household consumption spending C, business investment spending I, government purchases G, and net exports NX—so that their sum adds up to aggregate demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexprice analysis is an analysis filled with \"ifs\" that are not so: they are useful for clarifying thought and for setting a baseline to which we can compare the behavior of actual economies, not for understanding why actual economies undergo the business cycle fluctuations that they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Moreover, the flexible-price assumption may not be a terrible one to make for purposes of empirical analysis if employment is and remains nearly full. Perhaps it does so because there have been no large disturbances to demand in a while, so that wages and prices in labor and product markets have had time to adjust. Perhaps it does so because the Federal Reserve has done a good job of neutralizing disturbances to aggregate demand.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But we cannot afford to keep the flexible-price assumption if we wish to make any further progress. We need to break it if we are to build a more useful model of the business cycle. Thus from this point on wages and prices will be “sticky”: They will not move freely and instantaneously in response to changes in demand and supply. Instead, prices will remain fixed at predetermined levels as businesses expand or contract production in response to changes in demand and costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, such sticky prices make a big difference in economic analysis; they will drive a wedge between real GDP and poten­ tial output and between the supply of workers and the demand for labor. We will then be able to use this sticky-price model to account for business-cycle fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building this sticky-price model of the macroeconomy will take up all of Part 4. In this chapter, we will focus on how, when prices are sticky, firms hire or fire workers and expand or cut back production on the basis of whether their inventories are falling or rising. Inventory adjustment is the key to understanding how the level of real GDP can fluctuate around potential output. Chapter 10 focuses on how changes in the interest rate affect the levels of investment, exports, and real GDP in the sticky-price model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 11 takes a deeper look at equilibrium in the money market: How are interest rates in the short run really determined? It is an optional chapter. You can simply say that the Federal Reserve—the Fed—sets interest rates, not inquire into how, and skip Chapter 11. But if you want to understand what happens when there is no interest rate-pegging central bank around, or how the Federal Reserve pegs interest rates, or what happens if the Federal Reserve pegs not interest rates but the money stock, then you need to study Chapter 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last chapter of Part 4, Chapter 12, takes up the topics of expectations and inflation in an environment in which the Fed sets interest rates. By the end of Chapter 12 we will have linked up the sticky-price model of Part 4 with the flexible-price model of Part 3. We will understand the sorts of situations for which the sticky-price model is appropriate. And we will understand under what sets of circumstances wages and prices are flexible enough and have enough time to adjust for the flexible- price model to be the most useful way of analyzing the macroeconomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each stage in the building of our sticky-price macroeconomic model, the preceding topic serves as a necessary foundation. The analysis of inflation and expectations in Chapter 12 rests on the analysis of how changes in interest rates affect investment, exports, and real GDP in Chapter 10. And the analysis of Chapter 10 in turn rests on the analysis of income, expenditure, and equilibrium in a sticky- price economy carried out here in Chapter 9. Chapter 11 also rests on Chapters 9 and 10, and it provides a fuller foundation for Chapter 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, this book has not been cumulative. You could understand the long-run growth analysis in Chapters 4 and 5 without a firm grasp of the introductory material in Chapters 1 through 3. You could understand the flexible-price analysis in Chapters 6 and 7 without a firm grasp of either the introductory or the long-run-growth chapters.\n",

    "To preview the difference between the flexible-price and the sticky-price models, let us analyze a decline in consumers’ propensity to spend under both sets of assumptions. Suppose there is a sudden fall in the consumer confidence parameter $ c_o $, the parameter that determines the baseline level of consumption in the consumption function and thus shifts the function up or down on the income-spending graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ C= c_o + c_y(1-t)Y $\n",
    "\n",
    "where Y is GDP or national income, t is the tax rate, C is consumption spending, and $ c_y $ is the marginal propensity to consume parameter of the consumption function that determines captures how much consumption increases for a 1 dollar increase in national income. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concrete, consider what happens when baseline consumption spending falls. Suppose that the function for annual consumption spending (in billions of dollars at an annual rate) is shifted down on the income-spending graph by an amount $ {\\Delta}c_o = 250 $: declines from:\n",

    "> $ C = 500 + (0.75)(1-t)Y $\n",
    "\n",
    "In the full-employment model of Chapters 6 and 7, such a 250 billion dollar fall in annual baseline consumption spending would have no impact on the level of real GDP. No matter what the flow of total expenditure, the labor market would still reach its full-employment equilibrium because flexible wages and prices would make it so. And because the economy remains at full employment, real GDP would still equal potential output.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sticky-price logic is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "If wages and prices are sticky, we have to carry out a different analysis. The first consequence of consumers’ cutting back their spending will be a fall in expenditure for goods—in aggregate demand. Consumer spending is falling, yet nothing has happened or is happening to change the flow of spending on investment goods, the flow of net exports, or the flow of government purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "As businesses see spending on their products begin to fall, they will not cut their nominal prices (remember, prices are sticky). Instead, they will respond to the fall in the quantity of their products demanded by reducing their production. They see their invenstories rising, and they do not want that—they want to avoid accumulating unsold and unsellable inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "As they reduce production, they will fire some of their workers. The incomes of the fired workers will drop, and so national income will start dropping. \n",
    "\n",
    "By how much will total national income drop? Initially, it will fall by the amount of the fall in baseline consumption spending: by 200 billion dollars at an annual rate. And that will have consequences—as we see a bit later on—that will amplify its magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the consequences of a fall in consumption spending under the sticky-price assumption are\n",
    "\n",
    "* consumption falling.\n",
    "* production and employment declining.\n",
    "* national income declining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the flexprice model, when consumption falls, investment and net exports rise. Why doesn’t the same thing happen in the sticky-price model? Why doesn’t a rise in investment spending keep GDP equal to potential output and keep employment full? What goes wrong with the flexprice logic, according to which a fall in consumption spending generates an increase in saving that then boosts both investment spending and net exports?\n",

    ">>_**Sticky-Price Logic: The Effect on Saving of a Fall in Consumption Spending**: With sticky prices, a fall in baseline consumption spending carries with it a fall in income. Because both total consumption spending and ultimately income decline by the same amount, there is no change in total saving through financial markets. Thus the real interest rate remains unchanged. There is no change in investment spending or gross exports._\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that in the sticky-price model, firms respond to falling demand not by cutting prices but by cutting back production and employment, and so total income falls. The fall in total income reduces saving just as a fall in consumption raises saving. Under the sticky-price assumption, the effect on total saving of the fall in consumption and the fall in income cancel each other out; there is no change in the flow of saving. Thus there is no rightward shift in the position of the total saving curve on the flow-of-funds saving-interest rate diagram. There is thus no fall in interest rates to trigger higher investment (and a higher value of the exchange rate and expanded net exports). There is nothing to offset the fall in consumption spending and keep GDP from falling below potential output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why doesn’t this sticky-price unemployment-generating logic work when prices are flexible? When flexprice firms see a fall in total spending, they respond not by cutting production and employment but by cutting the prices they charge and the wages they pay. The real incomes households earn thus remain constant, and falling real consumption spending does induce rising real saving. That rising real saving is what induces a falling real interest rate, rising investment spending, increasing value of foreign currency, and rising net exports.\n",

    "If managers, workers, consumers, and investors had time to foresee a fall in consumption and gradually adjust their wages and prices to it in advance, even considerable stickiness in prices would not be a problem. With sufficient advance notice unions and businesses would strike wage bargains, and businesses could adjust their selling prices to make sure demand matched productive capacity. Both the stickiness of prices and the failure to accurately foresee changes far enough ahead to adjust to them in advance are needed if the sticky-price framework is to create business cycles in employment and output like the ones we see.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about this is that the analysis in Part 4 is a short-run analysis, and the analysis in Part 3 is a longer-run analysis—although it is a longer-run business cycle analysis, and thus it is still much shorter in terms of its run than the truly long-run growth economics analysis conducted in Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Part 4 short-run, prices are sticky; shifts in policy or in the economic environment that affect the components of planned total expenditure will affect real GDP and employment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Part 3 business-cycle longer-run, prices are flexible and workers, bosses, and consumers have time to react and adjust to changes in policy or the economic environment. Thus in the long run, such shifts do not affect real GDP or employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need a sticky-price short-run model as well as the longer-run business-cycle flexprice model? Why don’t economists simply say that once wages and prices have fully adjusted (however long that takes), employment will be full and real GDP will be equal to potential output and stop their analyses there? Economists focus on equilibrium, right? And the equilibrium is the one taht the flexprice model reaches, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous and effective criticism of such let’s-look-only-at-the-longer-run when we are analyzing the business cycle was made by John Maynard Keynes in a 1924 book, his _Tract on Monetary Reform_. Criticizing one such long-run-only analysis, Keynes wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the long run [this] is probably true.... But this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. _In the long run we are all dead_. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean will be flat once more...\n",

    "\n",
    "No, we do not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The “business-cycle longer-run” is an analytical construct. It covers circumstances in which enough people have enough time to have seen it coming far enough in advance and have had time to adjust to it—to renegotiate their contracts and change their standard operating procedures accordingly. The length of the business-cycle longer-run, and thus how many of us will be dead before it comes, depends in turn on the degree of price stickiness and the process by which people form their expectations—both hot topics for academic research in modern macroeconomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would an economy in which prices and wages were more flexible than they are in our economy have smaller business cycles? It is doubtful. Not just prices and wages but debts are set in money terms in our economy. In a flexprice world a fall in aggregate demand is kept from having a large depressing effect on production because the price level falls in synch. But in an economy in which firms have debts, falling prices make it impossible for the firms to repay those debts and lead to massive chains of firm bankruptcies. Bankrupt firms do not produce, even if there is ample demand for their low-priced products.\n",

    "### <font color=\"000088\">9.1.5 Why Are Prices Sticky?<font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Why don’t prices adjust quickly and smoothly to maintain full employment? Why do businesses respond to fluctuations in demand first by hiring or firing workers and accelerating or shutting down their production lines? Why don’t they respond first by raising or lowering their prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists have identified any number of reasons that prices could be sticky, but they are uncertain which are most important. Some likely explanations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Managers and workers find that changing prices or renegotiating wages is\n",
    "costly and hence best delayed as long as possible.\n",
    "2. The level of prices is as much a sociological as an economic variable—determined as much by what levels people think are “fair” as by the balance of supply and demand. \n",
    "3. Closely related: sorkers take a cut in their wages as an indication that their employer does not value them; hence managers avoid wage cuts because they fear the consequences for worker morale. Managers would rather fire 10 percent of their workers than attempt to impose a 10 percent wage cut on their current workforce because the second would have a catastrophic effect on worker morale, while the first is more likely to make workers work harder out of fear of behing the next ones laid off.\n",
    "4. Managers and workers suffer from simple “money illusion”; they overlook the effect of price-level changes when assessing the impact of changes in wages or prices on their real income or sales.\n",
    "5. Managers and workers lack information and so confuse changes in total economy-wide spending with changes in demand for their specific products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look more closely at each of these likely explanations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Economists call the costs associated with changing prices _menu costs_, a shorthand reference to the fact that when a restaurant changes its prices, it must print up a new menu. In general, changing prices or wages may be costly for any of a large number of reasons. Perhaps people want to stabilize their commercial relationships by signing long-term contracts. Perhaps reprinting a catalog is expensive. Perhaps customers find frequent price changes annoying. Perhaps other firms are not changing their prices and what matters most to a firm is its price relative to the prices of competitors. Hence managers and workers prefer to keep their prices and wages stable as long as the shocks that affect the economy are relatively small—or, rather, as long as the change they might want to make in their prices and wages is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet a third reason why prices and wages are sticky is that workers and managers are really not the flinty-eyed rational maximizers of economic theories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related and fourth, in real life, work effort and work intensity depend on whether workers believe they are being treated fairly. A cut in nominal wages is almost universally perceived as unfair; wages depend on social norms that evolve slowly. Thus wages are by nature sticky. And if wages are sticky, firms will find that their best response to shifts in demand is to hire and fire workers rather than to change prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, workers, consumers, and managers suffer from money illusion: They confuse changes in nominal prices with changes in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) prices. Firms react to higher nominal prices by thinking falsely that it is more profitable to produce more — even though it isn’t because their costs have risen in proportion. Workers react to higher nominal wages by searching more intensively for jobs and working more overtime hours, even though rises in prices have erased any increase in the real purchasing power of the wage paid for an hour’s work. Such money illu­ sion is a powerful generator of price stickiness and business-cycle fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final possible source of price stickiness is imperfect information: a misperception of real and nominal price changes. If managers and workers lack full information about the state of the economy, they may be unsure whether a change in the flow of spending on their products reflects a change in overall aggregate demand or a change in demand for their particular products. If it is the latter, they should respond by changing how much they produce, not necessarily by changing the price. If it is the former, they should respond by changing their price in accord with overall inflation, not by changing how much they produce. If managers are uncertain which it is, they will split the difference. Hence firms will lower their prices less in response to a downward shift in total nominal demand than the flexible-price macroeconomic model would predict. If they keep their prices too high, they will have to fire workers and cut back production. Imperfect information is a possible source of sticky prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last explanation seems to us to be highly implausible: people and firms do not know what the things they buy cost? People and firms go to the market and pay their bills every day: they know what things currently cost just as well as they know what they currently earn. Yet many economists of note and reputation seem to believe this as a principal explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these factors are potential sources of price stickiness. Your professor may have strong views about which is most important. We find ourselves more confused and agnostic. Our reading is that economists’ knowledge is more limited. We are not sure the evidence is strong enough to provide clear and convincing support for any particular single explanation as the most important one. A safer position is to remain agnostic about the causes of sticky wages and prices, and so we focus on analyzing not their causes but their effects.\n",

The early-twentieth-century British economist John Maynard Keynes was one of the first to stress the importance of this multiplier process.\n",

Some businesses will respond to the fall in inventories by boosting prices, trying to earn more profit per good sold. But the bulk of businesses will respond to the fall in inventories by expanding production to match planned expenditure. They are about to hire more workers. Real GDP and national income are about to expand.\n",

    "Now suppose that businesses see their inventories falling and respond by boosting their production to equal last month’s aggregate demand. Will such an increase bring the economy into goods market equilibrium, with aggregate equal to national income and real GDP? The answer is that it will not. To boost production, firms must hire workers, paying more in wages and causing household income to rise. But when income rises, total spending rises as well. Thus the increase in production and income generates a further expansion in planned expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after production has increased to close the initial gap between planned expenditure and national income, the economy will still not be in equilibrium. Inventories will be falling even though hiring more workers has increased production. Because hiring more workers has also boosted total income and further increased planned expenditure, production will have to expand by a multiple of the initial gap in order to stabilize inventories. The process will come to an end, with planned expenditure equal to national income, only when both have risen to the level at which the planned-expenditure line crosses the 45-degree income-equals-expenditure line. Box 9.5 provides a worked example. And the process works in reverse to lower production and expenditure if planned expenditure is initially below national income.\n",

But it takes at least months, usually quarters, and possibly more time for businesses to expand or cut back production.\n",

    "For example, between the summer of 1990 and the summer of 1991 inventories fell for five straight quarters. Real GDP was less than planned expenditure as businesses decided that their high levels of inventories were too large given the economic uncertainties created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent recession.

    "The U.S. economy was already in recession in the summer of 2001 when the ter- 1rorist attack on the World Trade Center sent it into a further downward spiral. The attack on September 11, 2001, reduced autonomous spending through two different channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the attack shook consumer confidence: The Conference Board’s index fell from 114 in August 2001 to 85 in November. Baseline consumption spending, the parameter $ c_o $ in the consumption function, is closely linked to consumer confidence. \n",

The result was that autonomous spending A fell.\n",

    "Second, the Bush tax cut of 2001 boosted consumers’ incomes in 2002 by some 80 billion and so boosted consumption spending. Most of this money went to high-income consumers with relatively low marginal propensities to consume, so it was not the most effective stimulus, but it was still welcome at the time. \n",

In response, businesses would boost production to try to keep inventories from being exhausted, and production would expand.\n",

    "One factor that tends to minimize the multiplier is the tax system: whether the tax system has been designed to provide the government with fiscal auto­ matic stabilizers. The government doesn’t levy a total lump-sum tax independ­ ent of the state of the economy. Instead the government imposes roughly pro­ portional (actually slightly progressive) taxes on the economy, so government tax collections are equal to a tax rate t times the level of GDP Y: the total tax take equals tY.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when GDP is relatively high the government collects more in tax revenue than it would with a lump-sum tax. The collection of extra revenue dampens swings in after-tax income and thus reduces consumption. Similarly, the government collects less in tax revenue when GDP is relatively low; thus after-tax income is higher than that under lump-sum taxes, and this higher income boosts consumption. Because the fall in consumption is smaller with a proportional rather than a lump-sum tax, the multiplier is smaller. Disturbances to spending are not amplified as much as they would be with a lump-sum tax, and so shocks to the economy tend to cause smaller business cycles. The automatic working of the government’s tax system (and, to a lesser extent, its social welfare programs) functions as an _automatic stabilizer_, reducing the magnitude of fluctuations in real GDP and unemployment.\n",

    "How important is this (1 — t) term? How large are fiscal automatic stabilizers in the United States today? When national product and national income drop by a dollar, income tax and social security tax collections fall automatically by at least one-third of a dollar. Thus the fall in consumers’ disposable income is only two-thirds as great as the fall in national income, and the fall in consumption is only two-thirds as large as it would be without fiscal automatic stabilizers.\n",

    "A more globalized economy will also have a smaller multiplier. An economy that is more open to world trade will have a smaller multiplier than will a less open economy. The more open the economy, the greater is the marginal propensity to expend on imports.

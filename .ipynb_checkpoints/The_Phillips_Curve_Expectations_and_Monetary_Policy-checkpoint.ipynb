    "This is the most important chapter in the book. It draws together the flexible-price business cycle model of Part III and the sticky-price business cycle model of Part IV. It provides a bird’s-eye overview of demand, monetary policy, and inflation. Chapter 9 analyzed demand and the multiplier. Chapter 10 added interest rates and their effect on investment and exports. In this chapter we build on those two and add unemployment, inflation, and monetary policy—how the Federal Reserve makes its decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you finish this chapter, you will have a comprehensive view of how business cycles and demand management work. The Federal Reserve responds to unemployment and inflation by choosing a monetary policy that aims at price stability and full employment with the first goal taking priority. That monetary policy then—through the mechanisms of Chapter 10—determines investment and exports and—through the mechanisms of Chapter 9—the level of production. The level of production relative to potential output itself feeds back and generates unexpected rises and declines in inflation relative to what was previously anticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that is not all this chapter does. It also analyzes expectations—how the previous anticipations of prices and inflation are formed. Expectations are key, for they provide the linkage between the sticky-price model of Part IV and the flexible-price model of Part III.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is how this chapter accomplishes its two major goals: to complete the construction of the sticky-price model begun in Chapter 9 and to link the sticky-price macroeconomic model analysis of Part IV with the flexible-price macroeconomic model analysis of Part III. The key to accomplishing both of these is an analytical tool called the Phillips curve. The Phillips curve describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment, according to which a higher rate of unemployment is associated with a lower rate of inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan of this chapter is to first examine aggregate supply and the Phillips curve: Why is there—in the short run of our sticky-price model—a positive relationship between production Y on the one hand and the price level P and the inflation rate π on the other (and thus also a negative relationship between unemployment and inflation)? This leads into an analysis of how the existence of the aggregate supply relationship and the Phillips curve affects modern central banks’ conduct of monetary policy and the important concept of the Monetary Policy Reaction Function. Then it is time to put all the pieces together by bringing into the picture the key elements of the determinants of the natural rate of unemployment and the kinds of expectations—static, adaptive, and rational; plus Panglossian, Eeyore, and diagnostic—that play an overwhelmingly important role in determining how modern economies behave.\n",

    "So far in this book one of our six key economic variables, the unemployment rate, has been largely absent. In Part II, the long-run growth section, unemployment was not a significant factor. In Part III, the flexible-price macroeconomic model section, there were no fluctuations in unemployment. Wages and prices were flexible, and so labor supply balanced labor demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to bring unemployment to center stage. Back in Chapter 2 we showed that there is generally an inverse relationship between the unemployment rate u and the output gap — the level of real GDP relative to potential output Y*. This relationship is called Okun’s law (see Box 12.1). Because of Okun’s law, we do not have to conduct separate analyses of real GDP and unemployment: We know that when one is high the other is low, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "When output Y is equal to potential output Y*, then the unemployment rate is equal to what Milton Friedman in 1966 was among the first to call the natural rate of unemployment — let’s call it u* — and the labor market is putting neither upward nor downward pressure on the rate of inflation. When output Y is above potential output Y*, the unemployment rate u is below the natural rate of unemployment u* and there is upward pressure on the rate of inflation. When output Y is below potential output Y*, the unemployment rate u is above u* and there is typically downward pressure on the rate of inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we spend most of our time analyzing the behavior of the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is of special interest because a high unemployment rate means low social welfare (see Box 12.2). But with only one additional step we could turn that analysis into an analysis of the output gap — of real GDP relative to potential output.\n",

    "When real GDP is above potential output, unemployment will be below the natu­ ral rate of unemployment. When real GDP is below potential output, unemploy­ ment will be above the natural rate. And the percentage-point gap between unem­ ployment and its natural rate is two-fifths the magnitude of the percentage gap between real GDP and potential output. For example, if real GDP is 10 percent below potential output [(Y — Y*)/Y* = —0.10], then the unemployment rate will be 4 percentage points above the natural rate of unemployment: If the natural rate of unemployment u* is 5 percent (u* = 0.05), then the unemployment rate u will be 9 percent [u = 0.05 - 0.4(—0.10) = 0.09].\n",
    "Since 2000 the quantitative form of Okun’s law has shifted. Between 2000 and 2004, a 1-percentage-point gap between real GDP and potential output generated a much smaller gap between unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment than we had seen in previous decades. We are not yet sure whether Okun’s law will return to its old pattern, or, if it does not, whether the new quantitative rela­ tionship between unemployment and the output gap will remain at its 2000-2004 level. Many economists think that the relatively stagnant employment levels seen between 2000 and 2004 have led a great many people who would seek jobs in nor­ mal times to drop out of the labor force, and so artificially and temporarily low­ ered the unemployment rate. If they are right, then Okun’s law will once again return\n",

    "to its traditional level soon, with a 1-percentage-point gap between output and potential output corresponding to a 0.4-percentage-point gap between the unem­ ployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment.\n",
    "But whatever happens with the quantitative relationship, we are still sure about the qualitative relationship: Higher real GDP Y (relative to potential output Y*) means lower unemployment u (relative to the natural rate u*) and vice versa.\n",
    "COSTS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT: POLICY\n",
    "In a typical U.S. recession, unemployment rises by 2 percentage points. By Okun’s law, that means that the output gap — real GDP relative to potential output — falls by some 5 percent. Five percent is about four years’ worth of growth in output per worker. Moreover, recessions are not permanent; with rare exceptions, they are over in a year or two and are followed by periods of rapid growth that return real GDP to its prerecession growth trend. Even the steepest post-World War II recession raised the unemployment rate by only 4 percentage points, and it took only three years after the recession trough for unemployment to fall back to a normal level.\n",
    "These considerations make it somewhat of a puzzle that people fear recessions so much. People fear a deep recession much more than they appear to value an extra four years’ worth of economic growth. For example, the memory of the 1982 recession substantially altered Americans’ perceptions of how the economy works, how much they dare risk in the search for higher wages, and how confident they can be that their jobs are secure.\n",
    "Why do episodes of recession and high unemployment have such a large psy­ chological impact? The most likely answer is that recessions are feared because their impact is not distributed equally. Workers who keep their jobs are only lightly affected, whereas those who lose their jobs suffer a near-total loss of income. Peo­ ple fear a 2 percent chance of losing half of their income much more than they fear a certain loss of just 1 percent of income. So it is much worse for 2 percent of the people to each lose half of their income than for everyone to lose 1 percent. Thus the unequal distribution of the costs of recessions is what makes them so feared — and makes voters so anxious to elect economic policy makers who\n",
    "will successfully avoid them.\n",
    "Aggregate Supply\n",
    "In our sticky-price model prices are sticky, not stuck. (Forget the difference? See Box 11.6 for an example.) They do move over time. They just don’t move fast enough to get us to the flexible-price situation of Chapters 6-8 immediately. Up until now we have paid next to no attention to the fact that prices are not stuck fast in the sticky-price model. But now this will change as we start to analyze what the price level P and the inflation rate it are in our sticky-price model.\n",
    "In the short run, we find that whenever real GDP Y is higher than potential output Y*, the inflation rate tt and the price level P are likely to be higher than people had previously anticipated. There are many reasons for this. One is that whenever demand for products is stronger than anticipated, firms raise their prices higher than they had previously planned. When planned expenditure is higher than\n",
    "\n",
    " potential output, demand is strong in nearly every industry Nearly all firms raise prices and hire more workers. High demand gives workers extra bargaining power. Unions threaten to strike, knowing that firms will have a hard time finding replace­ ment workers. Individuals quit, knowing they can find better jobs elsewhere. Such a high-pressure economy generates wages that rise faster than anticipated. Rapid wage growth is passed along to consumers in higher prices and accelerating infla­ tion. Thus high real GDP Y relative to potential output Y* generates a higher price level P and a higher inflation rate it than people had previously expected.\n",
    "A second reason is that when planned expenditure is higher than potential output, individual economic sectors and industries in the economy quickly reach the limits of capacity: Bottlenecks emerge. Since a building cannot be built without cement, construction companies will pay nearly any price for cement if it is in short supply. Such high prices signal to the market that the bottleneck industry should expand and eventually trigger investment that in the end boosts productive capacity. But in the meantime, developing bottlenecks lead to prices that increase faster than expected, thus to accelerating inflation and a higher price level.\n",
    "Note that expectations play a key role. What calls forth higher (or lower) production in the bottleneck industries is that prices and inflation turn out to be higher (or lower) than people had been counting on because demand is so high. It’s not high prices but higher-than-expected prices and inflation that are associated with high output. Economists call this correlation between real GDP Y (relative to potential output Y*) and the price level P and the rate of inflation it (relative to their previously expected values) the short-run Aggregate Supply (AS) curve.\n",
    "Note also that there is little reason to distinguish between inflation and the price level. Inflation is the change between last year’s and this year’s price level. A high price level relative to what was previously expected is a high inflation rate (relative to what was previously expected), and vice versa. So we can think of Aggregate Supply as an upward-sloping positive relationship between the price level P (relative to the previously expected price level) and the level of real GDP Y (relative to potential output). Or we can think of it as an upward-sloping posi­ tive relationship between the inflation rate it (relative to the previously expected inflation rate) and the level of real GDP Y (relative to potential output). Or we can think of it in yet a third way, using Okun’s law. Because high real GDP Y means low unemployment u, we can think of aggregate supply as a relationship between the inflation rate it (relative to the value that people had previously expected inflation to be ire) and the unemployment rate u (relative to the natu­ ral rate u*).\n",
    "This third form of the relationship is the modern Phillips curve:\n",
    "7T = 7Te — f3(u ~ U*)\n",
    "where we once again use rre to stand for previously expected inflation, with the e reminding us that it is an expectation. This equation tells us that inflation it is higher than it was previously expected to be when unemployment u is lower than its natural rate u*. By how much? That depends on the parameter /3, the slope of this relationship. And it is this relationship that is called the Phillips curve, after the New Zealand economist A. W. Phillips, who first wrote back in the 1950s of the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of prices.\n",

    "where ss stands for large sudden “supply shocks” — like the 1973 oil price increase — that can affect the rate of inflation by changing prices directly, with­ out first changing the unemployment rate and so putting pressure on wage levels.\n",

    "RECAP THE PHILLIPS CURVE\n",
    "The Phillips curve is an inverse relationship between inflation arid unemploy­ ment. It is the most convenient form of the aggregate supply relationship; so it is the one that we use. The Phillips curve tells us that when unemployment is below its natural rate, inflation is higher than expected inflation; conversely, when unemployment is above its natural rate, inflation is lower than expected infla­ tion. The stickier wages and prices are, the flatter the Phillips curve is. When the Phillips curve is flat, even large movements in the unemployment rate have little effect on the inflation rate. When wages and prices are less sticky, the Phillips curve is nearly vertical. Then even small movements in the unemploy­ ment rate have the potential to cause large changes in the inflation rate. When the natural rate of unemployment rises (falls), the Phillips curve shifts to the right (left). When the expected inflation rate falls (rises), the Phillips curve shifts down (up).\n",

    "Modem central banks do not sit by and passively watch the business cycle. They play a very active role in managing the macroeconomy. Monetary policy of modem cen­ tral banks reacts to the macroeconomy’s condition.

    "How do central banks decide what value the interest rate should be? Stanford University and Treasury Department economist John Taylor proposed a simple model of how central banks act. Modern central banks pay a great deal of attention to the inflation rate. So Taylor said: think of the central bank as having a target value for the inflation rate tt1(t for “target”) and having a belief about the “normal” baseline value r0 of the real interest rate.1 If inflation is higher than the central bank’s target value, the central bank raises the real interest rate r above what it considers to be the real interest rate’s “normal” baseline value r0. If inflation is lower than its target value, the central bank reduces the real interest rate r below r0. We write the Taylor rule in the form of an equation as\n",

    "bankers believe the cost of fighting inflation — increased unemployment due to the higher real interest rate — is too great, will be low and little will be done to fight inflation. If they believe the costs of inflation outweigh the cost of increased unemployment, will be high. Social, political, and economic factors all influence the central bankers’ value of rn.\n",
    "Unless equals zero, inflation above the central bank’s target level of infla­ tion prompts the central bank to raise the real interest rate. A higher real inter­ est rate leads, through the IS curve relationship, to a lower level of real GDP Y relative to potential output Y*. Chapter 10 showed us the steps: A higher real interest rate dampens planned expenditure — particularly investment and gross export spending — and, through the multiplier, lowers total demand. Real GDP, relative to potential output Y*, falls. And Okun’s law reminds us that reducing output Y relative to potential output Y* raises the unemployment rate. So the Taylor rule describing how the central bank’s monetary policy reacts to inflation, together with the behavior of planned expenditure, and the Okun’s law relation­ ship between unemployment and output produce a direct relationship between the inflation rate ir and the unemployment rate u. When the inflation rate rises, the central bank raises the real interest rate, which increases unemployment. When the inflation rate falls, the central bank lowers the real interest rate, which decreases unemployment. We call this relationship the Monetary Policy Reaction Function (MPRF).

    "In a good world, with a perfect central bank, the central bank’s idea of what the normal unemployment is would be equal to the natural rate of unemploy­ ment, and the central bank’s target inflation rate would be equal to expected infla­ tion. Then inflation and unemployment would be stable, and the business cycle would be a nonevent. But changes and shocks to the economy — and mispercep­ tions by the central bank and by the economy’s workers, firms, investors, and financiers — will keep that from being the case except for moments of exceptional good luck.\n",
    "Using the MPRF-Phillips Curve Model\n",
    "We can use this framework to analyze the effects of a shift in policy on the econ­ omy’s equilibrium. For example, consider a depression abroad that lowers demand for exports. This change in the economic environment causes a decrease in planned expenditure — a shift left of the IS curve — and leads to a rise in the unemployment rate. The Monetary Policy Reaction Function has shifted to the right, as Figure 12.9 shows, and the economy’s equilibrium has moved down and\n",
    " \n",
    " to the right along the Phillips curve. The unemployment rate rises. The inflation rate falls.\n",
    "Consider instead an expansion of government purchases at home. We would show this as a shift to the right of the IS curve of Chapter 10, which shifts the MPRF curve in and to the left. If the central bank does not change its notion of the normal baseline interest rate rg, and expected inflation does not change, the unemployment rate will fall and the inflation rate will rise.\n",
    "What if there is no aggressive central bank acting to stabilize the economy by raising interest rates when inflation rises? Does the economy spin out of con­ trol? No. Those curious about why not need to look to Chapter 11, which ana­ lyzes how the money market works in the sticky-price model when there is no central bank actively managing the economy. It provides the answer to this ques­ tion in the discussion of aggregate demand and aggregate supply that comes at its end. Without a central bank to control interest rates, inflation itself sets in motion forces that raise interest rates and so “cool off’ the economy and raise unemployment. Inflation raises the price level. A higher price level makes the nominal money supply in the economy worth less. A smaller real money stock means higher interest rates. With a fixed money stock, the aggregate demand curve of Chapter 11 can perform the same economy-stabilizing function auto­ matically that modern central banks accomplish through their active control over interest rates.\n",
    "What about a negative — costly — supply shock such as the oil price hikes in the 1970s? We would show this as a rightward shift in the Phillips curve. The unemployment rate would rise and the inflation rate would rise as well. The MPRF- Phillips curve model is deceptively simple but satisfyingly powerful. It can help us to understand the short-run effects on inflation and unemployment of any number of macroeconomic events.\n",

    "Today, most estimates of the current U.S. “natural” rate of unemployment are around 5 percent, although uncertainty about the level of the natural rate is substantial. And the natural rate has fluctuated substantially over the past two gen­ erations, as shown in Figure 12.10. Broadly, four sets of factors have powerful influ­ ence over the natural rate.\n",
    "Demography and the Natural Rate\n",
    "First, the natural rate changes as the relative age and educational distribution of the labor force changes. Teenagers have higher unemployment rates than adults; thus an economy with a lot of teenagers will have a higher natural rate. Looking for a job is easier for more experienced and more skilled workers. They need less time to find a new job when they leave an old one, so the natural rate of unem­ ployment will fall when the labor force becomes more experienced and more skilled. Women formerly had higher unemployment rates than men, although this is no longer true in the United States. The more educated tend to have lower rates of unemployment than the less well educated. African-Americans and Hispanic- Americans have higher unemployment rates than whites.\n",
    "A large part of the estimated rise in the natural rate from 5 percent or so in the 1960s to 6 or 7 percent by the end of the 1970s was due to changing demogra­ phy. Some component of the decline in the natural rate since then derives from the increasing experience at searching for jobs of the very large baby-boom cohort. But the exact, quantitative relationship between demography and the natural rate is not well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    " Institutions and the Natural Rate\n",
    "Second, institutions have a powerful influence over the natural rate. Some economies have strong labor unions; other economies have weak ones. Some unions sacrifice employment in their industry for higher wages; others settle for lower wages in return for employment guarantees. Some economies lack apprenticeship programs that make the transition from education to employment relatively straightforward; others make the school-to-work transition easy. In each pair, the first increases and the second reduces the natural rate of unemployment. Barri­ ers to worker mobility raise the natural rate, whether the barrier be subsidized housing that workers lose if they move (as in Britain in the 1970s and the 1980s), or high taxes that a firm must pay to hire a worker (as in France from the 1970s to today).\n",
    "However, the link between economic institutions and the natural rate is neither simple nor straightforward. The institutional features many observers today point to as a source of high European unemployment now were also present in the Euro­ pean economies in the 1970s — when European unemployment was low. Once again the quantitative relationships are not well understood.\n",
    "Productivity Growth and the Natural Rate\n",
    "Third, in recent years the rate of productivity growth has become increasingly implicated as a major determinant of the natural rate. The era of slow productiv­ ity growth from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s saw a relatively high natural rate. By contrast, rapid productivity growth before 1973 and after 1995 seems to have generated a relatively low natural rate.\n",
    "Why should a productivity growth slowdown generate a high natural rate? A higher rate of productivity growth allows firms to pay higher real wage increases and still remain profitable. If workers’ aspirations for real wage growth depend on the rate of unemployment, then a slowdown in productivity growth will increase the natural rate as indicated in Figure 12.11. If real wages grow faster than pro­ ductivity for an extended period of time, profits will disappear. Long before that point is reached businesses will begin to fire workers, and unemployment will rise. Thus if productivity growth slows, unemployment will rise. Unemployment will keep rising until workers’ real wage aspirations fall to a rate consistent with cur­ rent productivity growth.\n",
    "The Past Level of Unemployment and the Natural Rate\n",
    "Fourth and last, the natural rate will be high if unemployment has been high. Before 1980 western European economies had unemployment rates lower than the 5 percent to 6 percent that the United States averaged back then. But the mid-1970s brought recessions. European unemployment rose, but it did not fall back much in subsequent recoveries. Workers unemployed for two or three years lost their skills, lost their willingness to show up on time, and became so dis­ couraged that they lost their interest in even looking for new jobs. Thus the natural rate rose sharply in Europe with each business cycle. By the late-1990s European unemployment averaged 8 percent, as depicted in Figure 12.12, and inflation was stable.\n",

Hence the natural rate of unemploy­ ment is whatever rate of unemployment curbs real wage demands so that they are consistent with productivity growth.\n",

    " Conclusion: The Fluctuating Natural Rate\n",
    "This laundry list of factors affecting the natural rate is incomplete. Do not think that economists understand much about why the natural rate is what it is. Almost every economist was surprised by the large rise in the natural rate in western Europe over the past quarter century. Almost every economist was surprised by the sharp fall in America’s natural rate in the 1990s. And economists cannot confi­ dently account for these shifts even in retrospect.\n",
    "RECAP THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT\n",
    "The natural rate of unemployment is not a constant. It has fluctuated sub- stantially over the past two generations, and it will continue to fluctuate. Four sets of factors drive fluctuations in the natural rate of unemployment. First, the natural rate changes as the relative age and educationaldistribution of the labor force changes. Second, countries with inflexible labor markets are likely to have high natural rates of unemployment Third, faster productivity growth brings a lower natural rate with it. Fourth, the natural rate will be high if unem­ ployment has been high in the past and large numbers of workers have become discouraged.\n",
    "12.4 EXPECTED INFLATION\n",
    "The natural rate of unemployment and expected inflation together determine the location of the Phillips curve because it passes through the point where inflation is equal to expected inflation and unemployment is equal to its natural rate. This is how the Phillips curve is defined: When inflation ir is equal to its expected value 7re, then that tells us that the labor market is in rough balance — that unemployment u is equal to its natural rate u*. Thus higher expected inflation shifts the Phillips curve upward. But who does the expecting? And when do people form expecta­ tions relevant for this year’s Phillips curve?\n",
    "Economists work with three basic scenarios for how managers, workers, and investors go about forecasting the future and forming their expectations:\n",
    "• Static expectations of inflation prevail when people ignore the fact that infla­\n",

    "• Adaptive expectations prevail when people assume the future will be like the recent past.\n",

But as long as expectations of inflation remain static (and there are no supply shocks, and the natural rate of unemployment is unchanged), the trade-off between inflation and unemployment — the position of the Phillips curve — will not change from year to year. (See Figure 12.13.)\n",
    "If inflation has been low and stable, businesses will probably hold static infla­ tion expectations. Why? Because the art of managing a business is complex enough as it is. Managers have a lot of things to worry about: what their cus­ tomers are doing, what their competitors are doing, whether their technology is adequate, and how applicable technology is changing. When inflation has been low or stable, everyone has better things to focus their attention on than the rate of inflation. The 1960s were an era of static expectations (see Box 12.7).\n",
    "The Phillips Curve under Adaptive Expectations\n",
    "Suppose that the inflation rate varies too much for workers and businesses to ignore it completely. What then? As long as inflation last year is a good guide to inflation this year, workers, investors, and managers are likely to hold adaptive expectations and forecast inflation by assuming that this year will be like last year. Adaptive forecasts are good forecasts as long as inflation changes only slowly and adaptive expectations do not absorb a lot of time and energy that can be better used thinking about other issues.\n",

Under such a set of adaptive expectations, the Phillips curve will shift up or down depending on whether last year’s inflation was higher or lower than the previous year’s (see Box 12.8).

    "Because inflation expectations were adaptive, the fall in actual inflation in the early 1980s triggered a fall in expected inflation as well. The early 1980s therefore saw a downward shift in the short-run Phillips curve, a downward shift that gave the United States a much more favorable short-run inflation-unemployment trade­ off by the mid-1980s than it had had in the late 1970s, as shown in Figure 12.16.\n",

    "To accomplish this goal of reducing expected inflation, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply, discouraging investment, reducing aggregate demand, and pushing the economy to the right along the Phillips curve. Unem­ ployment rose, and inflation fell. Reducing annual inflation by 6 percentage points required “sacrifice”: During the disinflation, unemployment averaged some 1.5 percentage points above the natural rate for the seven years between 1980 and 1986. Ten percentage-point-years of excess unemployment above the natural rate — that was the cost of reducing inflation from near 10 percent\n",

Under rational expectations, people form their forecasts of future inflation not by looking backward at what inflation was, but by looking for­ ward. They look at what current and expected future government policies tell us about what inflation will be.\n",
    "Economic Policy under Rational Expectations\n",
    "Under rational expectations the Phillips curve shifts as rapidly as, or faster than, changes in economic policy that affect the level of aggregate demand. This has an interesting consequence: Anticipated changes in economic policy turn out to have no effect on the level of production or employment.\n",
    "Consider an economy where the central bank’s target inflation it1rate is equal to the current value of expected inflation rre and where uq, the unemployment rate when the real interest rate is at its normal value, is equal to the natural rate of unemployment u*. In such an economy, the initial equilibrium has unemployment equal to its natural rate and inflation equal to expected inflation.\n",
    "Suppose that workers, managers, savers, and investors have rational expecta­ tions. Suppose further that the government takes steps to stimulate the economy: It cuts taxes and increases government spending in order to reduce unemployment below the natural rate, and so reduces the value of u0. What is likely to happen to the economy?\n",
    "If the government’s policy comes as a surprise — if the expectations of inflation that matter for this year’s Phillips curve have already been set, in the sense that the contracts have been written, the orders have been made, and the standard oper­ ating procedures have been identified — then the economy moves up and to the left along the Phillips curve in response to the shift in aggregate demand produced by the change in government policy: Unemployment falls and the inflation rate rises, as shown in Figure 12.17.\n",
    "But if the government’s policy is anticipated — if the expectations of inflation that matter for this year’s Phillips curve are formed after the decision to stimu­ late the economy is made and becomes public — then workers, managers, savers, and investors will take the stimulative policy into account when they form their expectations of inflation. The inward shift in the MPRF will be accompanied, under rational expectations, by an upward shift in the Phillips curve as well. (See Figure 12.18.) How large is the upward shift? The increase in expected inflation has to be large enough to keep expected inflation after the demand shift equal to actual inflation. Otherwise people are not forming their expectations rationally.\n",

    "A government pursuing an expansionary economic policy shifts the MPRF. An increase in production is associated with a reduc­ tion in unemployment, so an expansionary shift is a shift to the left in the MPRF. A surprise expan­ sionary policy moves the economy along the Phillips curve, raising inflation and lowering unemployment (and raising production) in the short run.\n",
    " Thus an anticipated increase in aggregate demand has, under rational expecta­ tions, no effect on the unemployment rate or on real GDP. Unemployment does not change; it remains at the natural rate of unemployment because the shift in the Phillips curve has neutralized in advance any impact of changing inflation on unemployment. It will, however, have a large effect on the rate of inflation. Econ­ omists will sometimes say that under rational expectations “anticipated policy is irrelevant.” But this is not the best way to express it. Policy is very relevant indeed for the inflation rate. It is only the effects of policy on real GDP and the unem­ ployment rate — effects that are associated with a divergence between expected inflation and actual inflation — that are “irrelevant.”\n",
    "FIGURE 12.18 Results if the Shift in Policy Is Anticipated\n",
    "If the expansionary policy is anticipated, workers, consumers, and managers will build the policy effects into their expectations: The Phillips curve will shift up as the MPRF shifts in, and so the expansionary policy will raise inflation without having any impact on unemployment (or production).\n",

    "When have we seen examples of rational inflation expectations? The standard case is that of France immediately after the election of Socialist President Frangois Mitterand in 1981. Throughout his campaign Mitterand had promised a rapid expansion of demand and production to reduce unemployment. Thus when he took office French businesses and unions were ready to mark up their prices and wages in anticipation of the expansionary policies they expected. The result? From mid-1981 to mid-1983 France saw a significant acceleration of inflation, but no reduction in unemployment. The Phillips curve had shifted upward fast enough to keep expansionary policies from having any effect on production and employment.\n",
    "What Kind of Expectations Do We Have?\n",
    "If inflation is low and stable, expectations are probably static: Even thinking about what one’s expectations should be is not worth anyone’s while. If inflation is mod­ erate and fluctuates, but slowly, expectations are probably adaptive: To assume that the future will be like the recent past — which is what adaptive expectations are — is likely to be a good, simple to implement, rule of thumb.\n",
    "When shifts in inflation are clearly related to changes in monetary policy, swift to occur, and are large enough to seriously affect profitability, then peo­ ple are likely to have rational expectations. When the stakes are high — when people think, “Had I known inflation was going to jump, I would not have taken that contract” — then every economic decision becomes a speculation on the future of monetary policy. Because their bottom lines and their livelihoods are at risk, people will turn all their skill and insight into generating inflation forecasts.\n",
    "Thus the kind of expectations likely to be found in the economy at any moment depends on what has been and is going on. A period during which inflation is low and stable will lead people to stop consciously making, and stop paying attention to, inflation forecasts — and tend to cause expectations of infla­ tion to revert to static expectations. A period during which inflation is high, volatile, and linked to visible shifts in economic policy will see expectations of inflation become more rational. An intermediate period of substantial but slow variability is likely to see many managers and workers adopt the rule of thumb of adaptive expectations.\n",
    "Persistent Contracts\n",
    "The ways that people make contracts and form and execute plans for their eco­ nomic activity are likely to make an economy behave as if expectations are less “rational” than expectations in fact are. People do not wait until December 31 to factor next year’s expected inflation into their decisions and contracts. They make decisions about the future, sign contracts, and undertake projects all the time. Some of those steps govern what the company does for a day. Others govern deci­ sions for years or even for a decade or more.\n",
    "Thus the “expected inflation” that determines the location of the short-run Phillips curve has components that were formed just as the old year ended, but also components that were formed two, three, five, ten, or more years ago. Peo­ ple buying houses form forecasts of what inflation will be over the next 30 years — but once the house is bought, that decision is a piece of economic activity (imputed rent on owner-occupied housing) as long as they own the house, no\n",
    "\n",
    " matter what they subsequently learn about future inflation. Such lags in deci­ sion making tend to produce “price inertia.” They tend to make the economy behave as if inflation expectations were more adaptive than they in fact are. There will always be a large number of projects and commitments already under way that cannot easily adjust to changing prices. It is important to take this price inertia into account when thinking about the dynamics of inflation, out­ put, and unemployment.\n",
    "RECAP EXPECTED INFLATION\n",
    "The dynamics of how expectations evolve are key to understanding the econ­ omy. Economists work with three basic scenarios for how managers, workers, and investors go about forecasting the future and forming their expectations: Static expectations of inflation prevail when people ignore the fact that inflation can change. Adaptive expectations prevail when people assume the future will be like the recent past. Rational expectations prevail when people use all the infor­ mation they have as best they can.\n",
    "The Phillips curve behaves very differently under each of these three sce­ narios. Under static expectations the Phillips curve doesn’t shift, so changes in policy have powerful effects on unemployment and real GDP. Under rational expectations the Phillips curve shifts immediately and drastically in response to policies so that anticipated changes in policy have powerful effects on inflation, but not on unemployment and real GDP. And adaptive expectations are in the middle.\n",
    "12.5 FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN\n",
    "Rational Expectations\n",
    "Our picture of the determination of real GDP and unemployment under sticky prices is now complete. We have a comprehensive framework to understand how the aggregate price level and inflation rate move and adjust over time in response to changes in aggregate demand, production relative to potential output, and unem­ ployment relative to its natural rate. There is, however, one loose end. How does one get from the short-run sticky-price patterns of behavior covered in Part 4 to the long-run flexible-price patterns of behavior that were laid out in Part 3? How do you get from the short run to the long run?\n",
    "In the case of an anticipated shift in economic policy under rational expecta­ tions, the answer is straightforward: You don’t have to get from the short run to the long run; the long run is now An inward (or outward) shift in the monetary policy reaction function on the Phillips curve diagram caused by an expansionary (or contractionary) change in economic policy or the economic environment sets in motion an offsetting shift in the Phillips curve. If expectations are rational, if changes in economic policy are foreseen, and if there are no supply shocks, then expected inflation will be equal to actual inflation:\n",

    "Back in the early 1920s the British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that it was not enough to do just a long-run analysis, because by the time the long run rolled around we would all be dead. But if everyone in the economy has rational expectations, then Keynes was wrong: The long run comes immediately.\n",
    "Adaptive Expectations\n",
    "If expectations are and remain adaptive, then the economy approaches the long- run equilibrium laid out in Chapter 7 gradually, as is shown in Figure 12.20. An expansionary initial shock increases planned expenditure and shifts the monetary policy reaction function inward, generating a fall in unemployment, an increase in real GDP, and a rise in inflation. Call this stage 1. Stage 1 takes place before any­ one has had any chance to adjust his or her expectations of inflation.\n",
    "Then comes stage 2. Workers, managers, investors, and others look at what inflation was in stage 1 and raise their expectations of inflation. The Phillips curve shifts up by the difference between actual and expected inflation in stage 1. The central bank begins to fight inflation by increasing the real interest rate, which increases unemployment. Between stage 1 and stage 2 unemployment rises, real GDP falls, and inflation rises.\n",
    "Then comes stage 3. Workers, managers, investors, and others look at what inflation was in stage 2 and raise their expectations of inflation again. The Phillips curve shifts up by the difference between actual and expected inflation in stage 2. As inflation rises further, the central bank ratchets up its fight against inflation, increasing the real interest rate yet again and thus increasing unemployment. Between stage 2 and stage 3 unemployment rises further, real GDP falls again, and inflation again rises.

    "Under adaptive expectations, people’s forecasts become closer and closer to being accurate as more and more time passes. Thus the “long run” arrives gradually. Each year the portion of the change in demand that is not implicitly incorporated in people’s adaptive forecasts becomes smaller and smaller. Thus a larger and larger pro­ portion of the shift is “long run, ” and a smaller and smaller proportion is “short run.”\n",

    "Chapter Summary\n",
    "1. The location of the Phillips curve is determined by the ex­ pected rate of inflation and the natural rate of unemploy­ ment (and possibly by current, active supply shocks). In the absence of supply shocks, the Phillips curve passes through the point at which inflation is its expected value and unemployment is its natural rate.\n",
    "2. The slope of the Phillips curve is determined by the de­ gree of price stickiness in the economy. The more sticky are prices, the flatter is the Phillips curve.\n",
    "3. Modern central banks respond to higher-than-desired inflation by raising interest rates, thus reducing output and raising unemployment. This monetary policy reac­ tion function (MPRF) is a powerful stabilizing factor in modern economies.\n",
    "4. The MPRF and Phillips curve can be used to analyze the effect of changes in economic policy on the economy’s inflation and unemployment rates.\n",
    "5. The natural rate of unemployment in the United States has exhibited moderate swings in the past two genera­ tions, from perhaps 4.5 percent at the end of the 1950s\n",
    "6.\n",
    "to perhaps 7 percent at the start of the 1980s, and now down to about 5 percent. Changes in the natural rate of unemployment shift the Phillips curve to the left or right.\n",
    "The principal determinant of the expected rate of infla­ tion is the past behavior of inflation. If inflation has been low and steady, expectations are probably static and the expected inflation rate is very low and un­ changing. If inflation has been variable but moderate, expectations are probably adaptive and expected infla­ tion is probably simply equal to last year’s inflation. If inflation has been high or moderate but has varied ex­ tremely rapidly, then expectations are probably rational and expected inflation is likely to be households’ and businesses’ best guesses of where economic policy is taking the economy. Changes in inflation expectations shift the Phillips curve up or down.\n",
    "The best way to gauge how expectations of inflation are formed is to consider the past history of inflation. Would adaptive expectations have provided a significant edge\n",
    "Static Expectations\n",
    "Under static expectations, the long run never arrives, and thus the flexible-price analysis of Chapters 6 to 8 never becomes relevant. Under static expectations, the gap between expected inflation and actual inflation can grow arbitrarily large as different shocks affect the economy And if the gap between expected inflation and actual inflation becomes large, workers, managers, investors, and consumers will not remain so foolish as to retain static expectations.\n",
    "Under rational expectations, the long run is now. The analysis we did in Chap­ ters 6 to 8 is always relevant. Adaptive expectations provide an intermediate case; as time passes, the analysis of Chapters 9 and 10 becomes less relevant and that of Chapters 6 to 8 becomes more relevant.\n",
    "RECAP FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN\n",
    "The amount of time that must pass before the relevant framework shifts from the sticky-price models of Part 4 to the flexible-price models of Part 3 depends on the kind of inflation expectations held in the economy. If workers, bosses, savers, and investors hold static expectations and never update them, then the flexible-price models never become relevant. If the expectations are adaptive, the shift from Part 4 to Part 3 takes place slowly and gradually. But if expecta­ tions are rational, then the shift to Part 3 takes place very quickly indeed — as soon as policy changes are announced or recognized."

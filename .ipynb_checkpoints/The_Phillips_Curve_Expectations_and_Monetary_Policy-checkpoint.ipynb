    "This may well be the most important section of our analysis of business cycles. This draws together the flexible-price business cycle model of Part III and the sticky-price business cycle model of the previous portions of Part IV. It provides a bird’s-eye overview of demand, monetary policy, and inflation. At the start of Part IV we analyzed demand and the multiplier. We then added interest rates and their effect on investment and exports. Here we build on those two and add unemployment, inflation, and monetary policy—how the Federal Reserve makes its decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you finish this section, you will have a comprehensive view of how business cycles and demand management work. The Federal Reserve responds to unemployment and inflation by choosing a monetary policy that aims at price stability and full employment with the first goal taking priority. That monetary policy then—through the IS-Curve mechanisms—determines investment and exports and—through the Keynesian-cross and multiplier mechanisms—the level of production. The level of production relative to potential output itself feeds back and generates unexpected rises and declines in inflation relative to what was previously anticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that is not all this section does. It also analyzes expectations—how the previous anticipations of prices and inflation are formed. Expectations are key, for they provide the linkage between the sticky-price model of Part IV and the flexible-price model of Part III.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is how this section accomplishes its two major goals: to complete the construction in this Part IV of the sticky-price model and to link the sticky-price macroeconomic model analysis to the flexible-price macroeconomic model analysis of Part III. The key to accomplishing both of these is an analytical tool called the Phillips curve. The Phillips curve describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment, according to which a higher rate of unemployment is associated with a lower rate of inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan of this chapter is to first examine aggregate supply and the Phillips curve: Why is there—in the short run of our sticky-price model—a positive relationship between production Y on the one hand and the price level P and the inflation rate π on the other (and thus also a negative relationship between unemployment and inflation)? This leads into an analysis of how the existence of the aggregate supply relationship and the Phillips curve affects modern central banks’ conduct of monetary policy and the important concept of the Monetary Policy Reaction Function. Then it is time to put all the pieces together by bringing into the picture the key elements of the determinants of the natural rate of unemployment and the kinds of expectations that play an overwhelmingly important role in determining how modern economies behave.\n",

    "Milton Friedman and Ned Phelps back in 1966 strongly argued for using the unemployment rate as the most reliable gauge of the state of the business cycle. He defined a concept that he was among the first to call the \"natural rate\" of unemployment—let’s call it u\\*. At that unemployment rate, he argued, the labor market would be putting neither upward nor downward pressure on the rate of inflation. At that unemployment rate, he argued, there would be only the normal, frictional number of workers without jobs and onky the normal, frictional number of vacancies—jobs empty, and open to workers. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a lower unemployment rate, employers would find it surprisingly hard to fill vacancies—and they would raise the wages they paid and the prices they charged by surprising amounts to try to run their businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a higher unemployment rate, workers would find it surprisingly hard to get jobs—and those who had jobs would forego wage increases and so provide employers with the room to charge less than they would have otherwise. Only if unemployment was equal to its \"natural rate\", Friedman argued, would the labor market be in a proper equilibrium—and would surprisingly high and surprisingly low inflation both be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friedman defined this no-surprise level of the unemployment rate as the way of determining when output Y would be equal to potential output Y\\*. Were output Y above potential output Y\\*, the unemployment rate u would be below the natural rate of unemployment u\\* and there would be upward pressure on the rate of inflation. Were output Y below potential output Y\\*, the unemployment rate u would be above u\\*, and there would typically be downward pressure on the rate of inflation.\n",

    "There is definitely a great deal to Friedman and Phelps's argument. In U.S. economic history during World War II, times of high unemployment are no typically times when inflation is or is about to be low, but rather times when inflation is or is bout to be falling. Times of low unemployment like 1999-2000, 1988-1990, and the late 1960s are frequently times in which inflation is or is about to rise.\n",

The low unemployment of 2016-2018 did not produce signs of an inflation pickup. And th big spikes in inflation that came along with the oil-price supply shocks of 1973 and 1979 are grossly disproportionate to any upwards pressure on inflation coming from low unemployment and high production relative to potential.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Some economists objected to Friedman's calling this no-surprises-in-inflation level of unemployemnt the \"natural rate\". Things that are \"natural\" are often understood as good or desirable. They prefer to call it the NAIRU, for \"non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment\". They prefer to abandon Milton Friedman's definition of the natural rate as what unemployment _should_ be were the economy not being disturbed by fluctuations in monetary policy and in government purchases, but rather as simply this: the unemployment rate below which inflation begins to accelerate, as people find themselves unable to buy commodities and hire workers at the prices they were expecting to be able to—is not and has never been constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading the tea leaves on just what the NAIRU—the natural rate—is at any moment is difficult and hazardous. The situation is complicated by the occurrence of major supply shocks: large jumps in prices, almost always in oil prices, that induce large shifts in inflation. The Organization of Oil-Exporting Countries—OPEC—tripled world oil prices in 1973. The Iranian Revolution and the consequent cutoff of Iranian oil supplies again tripled world oil prices in 1979. Saudi Arabia's decision to punish its OPEC partner countries for pumping more oil than their assigned quotas led to a collapse of world oil prices in 1986. And the years 2006-7 saw another oil shortage as OPEC took advantage of China's immense and rapidly-growing demand for oil to raise prices again. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these episodes leave clear marks on the trajectory of inflation that are different from the effects of the unemployment rate and output relative to the natural rate and potential that are at the heart of the Phillips Curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the Phillips Curve relationship does work: In the late 1960s inflation began to accelerate when the unemployment rate dropped below 4%. Inflation then accelerated from 2% per year to 6% per year, and then declined when the unemployment rate rose above 5%, strongly suggesting a then-NAIRU or natural rate of 5%. But in the late 1970s inflation began to accelerate when the unemployment rate dropped below 7%. The late 1980s, however, saw the unemployment rate decline almost to 5% before their were signs of accerlatig inf;lation. And in the late 1990s it took a decline in the unemployment rate to less than 4.5 before inflation began to creep up.\n",

    "The unemployment rate is of interest because a high unemployment rate means a lot of people are without market incomes, and so in all likelihood materially poor and psychologicall depressed. A high-unemployment economy is very likely to be one with low social welfare. But a high unemployment economy is also one that is performing poorly because high unemployment (or, alternatively, low prime-age employment as a share of the population) is a reading on a thermometer telling us that production is below potential output. High unemployment goes with a large output gap—a large shortfall of national income and product below the economy's sustainable productive potential.\n",

When Y is equal to Y\\*, then the unemployment rate u is equal to the natural rate of unemployment u\\*. When real GDP Y is different from Y\\*, the unemployment rate u will be different from the natural rate of unemployment u\\* by an amount described by the equation:\n",

For example, if real GDP is 10 percent below potential output, then the unemployment rate will be 4 percentage points above the natural rate of unemployment: If the natural rate of unemployment u\\* is 5 percent, then the unemployment rate u will be 9 percent.\n",

The feminist revolution in the workforce was still ongoing. Women's participation in the labor force and in employment was growing rapidly. The start of 1980 and the end of 1990 saw similar unemployment rates: about 6.5 percent. But the share of American 25-54 year-olds—too old for many of them to be school, too young for many of them to be plausibly retired—was 4 percentage points higer at the end of 1990 than it had been at the beginning of 1980.\n",

    "From the early 1990s to the mid-2000s, both the 25-54 year-old employment rate and the unemployment rate told the same story about the state of national income and production relative to potential output. But by 2007 they were sending different signals. The unemployment rate then was only half a percentage point above the level it had reached in 2000—suggesting an economy close to if not at the same relationship to potential output. But the prime-age 25-54 year-old employment rate was two percentage points lower—suggesting that  great deal of headroom remained for further economic expansion before production relative to potential reached the mark it had attained in 2000.\n",

The second suggests substantial remaining headroom.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a typical U.S. recession, unemployment rises by 2 percentage points. By Okun’s law, that means that the output gap—real GDP relative to potential output—falls by some 5 percent. Five percent is about three years’ worth of growth in output per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, recessions are not permanent; with important exceptions, they are over in a year or three and followed by a strong recovery—with notable exceptions, like the long drawn-out and very weak recovery fter the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Morever, such strong recoveries are often followed by periods of  growth sufficiently rapid to return real GDP to its prerecession growth trend. Before 2008, even the steepest post-World War II recession raised the unemployment rate by only 4 percentage points, and it took only three years after the recession trough for unemployment to fall back to a normal level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Great Recession that began in 2008, however, was very different. Because it was so deep, and because the subsequent recovery was so weak, it was an economic disaster an order of magnitude greater than other post-World War II recessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, recessions appear to have a bigger effect on social welfare than the size of the reductions in production they cause would lead us to expect. A typical recession reduces production by less than two years' economic growth, and reduces production relative to the growth trend only temporarily. Yet such episodes of recession and high unemployment appear to have a larger psychological impact relative to growth slowdowns than any comparison of their relative magnitudes in terma of their effect on real incomes would lead us to expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this the case? The most likely answer is that recessions are feared because their impact is not distributed equally. Workers who keep their jobs are only lightly affected, whereas those who lose their jobs suffer a near-total loss of income. People fear a 2 percent chance of losing half of their income much more than they fear a certain loss of just 1 percent of income. So it is much worse for 2 percent of the people to each lose half of their income than for everyone to lose 1 percent. Thus the unequal distribution of the costs of recessions is what makes them so feared—and makes voters so anxious to elect economic policymakers who will successfully avoid them.\n",

They just don’t move fast enough to get us to the flexible-price situation of Part III immediately. Up until now we have paid next to no attention to the fact that prices are not stuck fast in the sticky-price model. But now this will change as we start to analyze what the price level P and the inflation rate it are in our sticky-price model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the short run, we find that whenever real GDP Y is higher than potential output Y\\*, the inflation rate $ \\pi_t $ and the price level P are likely to be higher than people had previously anticipated. There are many reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "One is that whenever demand for products is stronger than anticipated, firms raise their prices higher than they had previously planned. When planned expenditure is higher than potential output, demand is strong in nearly every industry Nearly all firms raise prices and hire more workers. High demand gives workers extra bargaining power. Unions threaten to strike, knowing that firms will have a hard time finding replacement workers. Individuals quit, knowing they can find better jobs elsewhere. Such a high-pressure economy generates wages that rise faster than anticipated. Rapid wage growth is passed along to consumers in higher prices and accelerating inflation. Thus high real GDP Y relative to potential output Y* generates a higher price level P and a higher inflation rate it than people had previously expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second reason is that when planned expenditure is higher than potential output, individual economic sectors and industries in the economy quickly reach the limits of capacity: Bottlenecks emerge. Since a building cannot be built without cement, construction companies will pay nearly any price for cement if it is in short supply. Such high prices signal to the market that the bottleneck industry should expand and eventually trigger investment that in the end boosts productive capacity. But in the meantime, developing bottlenecks lead to prices that increase faster than expected, thus to accelerating inflation and a higher price level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that expectations play a key role. What calls forth higher (or lower) production in the bottleneck industries is that prices and inflation turn out to be higher (or lower) than people had been counting on because demand is so high. It’s not high prices but higher-than-expected prices and inflation that are associated with high output. Economists call this correlation between real GDP Y (relative to potential output Y*) and the price level P and the rate of inflation it (relative to their previously expected values) the short-run Aggregate Supply (AS) curve.\n",

    "How do central banks decide what value the interest rate should be? Start with a simple model of how central banks act. Modern central banks pay a great deal of attention to the inflation rate. So think of the central bank as having a target value for the inflation rate $ \\pi^t $ (t for “target”): what they would like the inflation rate to be. And think of them having a belief about the “neutral” baseline value $ r_n $ of the interest rate. If inflation is higher than the central bank’s target value, the central bank raises the real interest rate r above what it considers to be the real interest rate’s “neutral” baseline value $ r_n $. If inflation is lower than its target value, the central bank reduces the real interest rate r. In the form of an equation\n",

    "\n",
    "where the parameter $ r_\\pi $ tells us how much the central bank changes the real interest\n",
    "rate r in reaction to a gap between the actual and target inflation rates. If the central bankers believe the cost of fighting inflation—increased unemployment due to the higher real interest rate—is too great, $ r_\\pi $ will be low and little will be done to fight inflation. If they believe the costs of inflation outweigh the cost of increased unemployment, $ r_\\pi $ will be high. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation above the central bank’s target level prompts the central bank to raise the real interest rate. A higher real interest rate leads, through the IS curve relationship, to a lower level of national income and product Y relative to potential output Y\\*. Recall the steps: A higher real interest rate dampens planned expenditure—particularly investment and gross export spending—and, through the multiplier, lowers total demand. National income and product relative to potential output Y\\*, falls. And Okun’s law reminds us that reducing output Y relative to potential output Y\\* reduces employment and raises the unemployment rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the interest rule describing how the central bank’s monetary policy reacts to inflation, together with the behavior of planned expenditure, and the Okun’s law relationship between unemployment and output produce a  relationship between the inflation rate r and the unemployment rate u. When the inflation rate rises, the central bank raises the real interest rate, which increases unemployment. When the inflation rate falls, the central bank lowers the real interest rate, which decreases unemployment. \n",

A central bank does not wish for an interest rate so high that produces a level of spending, aggregate demand, so low there is excess and unnecessary unemployment—that people have a hard time finding jobs. A central bank also does not wish for an interest rate so low that aggregate demand is so high that spending outruns production—that people find themselves unable to buy the commodities they want at average prices they had expected, and so firms unexpectedly and surprisingly raise their prices so that inflation takes hold. What a central bank wants is for it to choose the $ r_n $ that is the Goldilocks value, neither too high nor too low, generating neither excessive unemployment nor surprisingly high inflation.\n",

    "What the central bank wants, in short, is the value for $ r_n $ to be equal to the value of r in the flexprice model: the value that drives the supply and demand for loanable funds to equality. A sticky-price economy is so built that there is nothing in the marketplace to push the real interest rate r to that flexprice full-employment equilibrium value.

The Phillips curve tells us what inflation rate the resulting wage and price bargaining in input markets will generate. But unless that unemployment rate and inflation rate combination from the Phillips curve is also on the MPRF, the central bank will react to that inflation rate by changing the real interest rate. And a change in the real interest rate will ultimately change the unemployment rate, moving us to yet another point on the Phillips curve!\n",

    "At what combination of unemployment and inflation rates will the supply-side forces that determine inflation be in concert with the central bank’s monetary policy and resulting demand for output? Only a combination of unemployment and inflation rates that is on both the Phillips curve and the MPRF will accomplish this. Any other combination of u and π is not an equilibrium combination because the central bank’s reaction to inflation will change the unemployment rate (move us along the MPRF), which in turn will change the inflation rate (move us along the Phillips curve).

    "Actual inflation π can be different from the central bank’s target $ \\pi^t $ because the central bank has other things to worry about as well. If all the central bank worried about was keeping inflation at its target, it could do so: The MPRF would then be flat, at the target level.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the parameter $ r_\\pi $ is not infinitely large, which it would need to be to create a completely flat MPRF. Central banks do not want to cause the financial upset that would result from the large rapid swings in interest rates needed to create a flat MPRF.\n",

    "Unemployment will in general not be equal to the central bank’s view of normal unemployment u0 because inflation will rarely be exactly equal to its target.

    "What if there is no aggressive central bank acting to stabilize the economy by raising interest rates when inflation rises? Does the economy spin out of control? No. Without a central bank to control interest rates, inflation itself sets in motion forces that raise interest rates and so “cool off’ the economy and raise unemployment. Inflation raises the price level. A higher price level makes the nominal money supply in the economy worth less. A smaller real money stock means higher interest rates. This can perform the same economy-stabilizing function automatically that modern central banks accomplish through their active control over interest rates. But it will take a great while for a shortage of cash to do what a central bank could do quickly.\n",

Unemployment cannot be reduced below its natural rate without accelerating inflation, so a high natural rate means that expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy are largely ineffective as tools to reduce unemployment.\n",
    "\n",

Moreover, variations in the natural rate in the United States have been much smaller than variations in the natural rate in other countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, four sets of factors have powerful influence over the natural rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color=\"000088\">12.3.1 Demography and the Natural Rate</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the natural rate changes as the relative age and educational distribution of the labor force changes. Teenagers have higher unemployment rates than adults; thus an economy with a lot of teenagers will have a higher natural rate. Looking for a job is easier for more experienced and more skilled workers. They need less time to find a new job when they leave an old one, so the natural rate of unem­ ployment will fall when the labor force becomes more experienced and more skilled. Women formerly had higher unemployment rates than men, although this is no longer true in the United States. The more educated tend to have lower rates of unemployment than the less well educated. African-Americans and Hispanic- Americans have higher unemployment rates than whites.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of the estimated rise in the natural rate from 5 percent or so in the 1960s to 6 or 7 percent by the end of the 1970s was due to changing demography. Some component of the decline in the natural rate since then derives from the increasing experience at searching for jobs of the very large baby-boom cohort. But the exact, quantitative relationship between demography and the natural rate is not well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color=\"000088\">12.3.2 Institutions and the Natural Rate</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, institutions have a powerful influence over the natural rate. Some economies have strong labor unions; other economies have weak ones. Some unions sacrifice employment in their industry for higher wages; others settle for lower wages in return for employment guarantees. Some economies lack apprenticeship programs that make the transition from education to employment relatively straightforward; others make the school-to-work transition easy. In each pair, the first increases and the second reduces the natural rate of unemployment. Barriers to worker mobility raise the natural rate, whether the barrier be subsidized housing that workers lose if they move (as in Britain in the 1970s and the 1980s), or high taxes that a firm must pay to hire a worker (as in France from the 1970s to today).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the link between economic institutions and the natural rate is neither simple nor straightforward. The institutional features many observers today point to as a source of high European unemployment now were also present in the Euro­ pean economies in the 1970s — when European unemployment was low. Once again the quantitative relationships are not well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color=\"000088\">12.3.3 Productivity Growth and the Natural Rate</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, in recent years the rate of productivity growth has become increasingly implicated as a major determinant of the natural rate. The era of slow productivity growth from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s saw a relatively high natural rate. By contrast, rapid productivity growth before 1973 and from 1995-2005 seems to have generated a relatively low natural rate. Since 2007, productivity growth has greatly diminished—yet we have not seen any impact on the natural rate from this renewed productivity growth slowdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should a productivity growth slowdown generate a high natural rate? A higher rate of productivity growth allows firms to pay higher real wage increases and still remain profitable. If workers’ aspirations for real wage growth depend on the rate of unemployment, then a slowdown in productivity growth will increase the natural rate as indicated in Figure 12.11. If real wages grow faster than pro­ ductivity for an extended period of time, profits will disappear. Long before that point is reached businesses will begin to fire workers, and unemployment will rise. Thus if productivity growth slows, unemployment will rise. Unemployment will keep rising until workers’ real wage aspirations fall to a rate consistent with current productivity growth.\n",

    "\n",
    ">**Real Wage Growth Aspirations and Productivity** Workers aspire to earn higher real wages. How much workers demand in the way of increases in the average real wage is a function of unemployment: The higher unemployment is, the lower workers' aspirations for real wage growth are. But in the long run real wages can grow no faster than productivity. Hence the natural rate of unemployment is whatever rate of unemployment curbs real wage demands so that they are consistent with productivity growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributing movements in the natural rate to shifts in productivity growth, however, runs aground on the puzzle of what is happening to the U.S. economy in the late 2010s. Productivity gowwth is low. Yet the natural rate of unemployment appears to be low as well.\n",

    "Fourth and last, the natural rate will be high if unemployment has been high. Before 1980 western European economies had unemployment rates lower than the 5 percent to 6 percent that the United States averaged back then. But the mid-1970s brought recessions. European unemployment rose, but it did not fall back much in subsequent recoveries. Workers unemployed for two or three years lost their skills, lost their willingness to show up on time, and became so discouraged that they lost their interest in even looking for new jobs. Thus the natural rate rose sharply in Europe with each business cycle. By the late-1990s European unemployment averaged 8 percent, and inflation was stable.\n",

    "From 1980 to 1990 the unemployment rate was a better guide to whether the level of national income and product in the economy was close to potential output. The feminist revolution in the workforce was still ongoing. Women's participation in the labor force and in employment was growing rapidly. The start of 1980 and the end of 1990 saw similar unemployment rates: about 6.5 percent. But the share of American 25-54 year-olds—too old for many of them to be school, too young for many of them to be plausibly retired—was 4 percentage points higer at the end of 1990 than it had been at the beginning of 1980.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the early 1990s to the mid-2000s, both the 25-54 year-old employment rate and the unemployment rate told the same story about the state of national income and production relative to potential output. But by 2007 they were sending different signals. The unemployment rate then was only half a percentage point above the level it had reached in 2000—suggesting an economy close to if not at the same relationship to potential output. But the prime-age 25-54 year-old employment rate was two percentage points lower—suggesting that  great deal of headroom remained for further economic expansion before production relative to potential reached the mark it had attained in 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since 2007 the two have told very different stories. The unemployment rate today is lower than the mark attained at the business-cycle peak of 2000. The prime-age employment rate is still 2.5 percentage points lower. The first suggests no headroom for further expansion without pushing production above sustainable potential—that current unemployment is at or below the natural rate. The second suggests substantial remaining headroom—that current unemployment is substantially above the natural rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there appears to have been a substantial shift—a decline—in the Phillips curve slope coefficient. While a one-percentage-point reduction in unemployment relative to the natural rate might have raised inflation over the next year by 3/5 of a percentage point or more in the 1970s, it now appears to raise inflation by only 1/5 of a percentage point, if that.\n",

    "If inflation is moderate and fluctuates, but slowly, expectations are probably adaptive: To assume that the future will be like the recent past—which is what adaptive expectations are—is likely to be a good, simple to implement, rule of thumb.\n",

    "When shifts in inflation are clearly related to changes in monetary policy, swift to occur, and are large enough to seriously affect profitability, then people might shift in the direction of having rational expectations. When the stakes are high—when people think, “Had I known inflation was going to jump, I would not have taken that contract”—then every economic decision becomes a speculation on the future of monetary policy. Because their bottom lines and their livelihoods are at risk, people will turn all their skill and insight into generating inflation forecasts.\n",

    "Thus the kind of expectations likely to be found in the economy at any moment depends on what has been and is going on. A period during which inflation is low and stable will lead people to stop consciously making, and stop paying attention to, inflation forecasts—and tend to cause expectations of inflation to revert to static expectations. A period during which inflation is high, volatile, and linked to visible shifts in economic policy will see expectations of inflation become more rational.

People do not wait until December 31 to factor next year’s expected inflation into their decisions and contracts. They make decisions about the future, sign contracts, and undertake projects all the time. Some of those steps govern what the company does for a day. Others govern decisions for years or even for a decade or more.\n",

    "Thus the “expected inflation” that determines the location of the short-run Phillips curve has components that were formed just as the old year ended, but also components that were formed two, three, five, ten, or more years ago. People buying houses form forecasts of what inflation will be over the next 30 years—but once the house is bought, that decision is a piece of economic activity (imputed rent on owner-occupied housing) as long as they own the house, no matter what they subsequently learn about future inflation. Such lags in decision making tend to produce “price inertia.” They tend to make the economy behave as if inflation expectations were more adaptive than they in fact are. There will always be a large number of projects and commitments already under way that cannot easily adjust to changing prices.

Under static expectations the Phillips curve doesn’t shift, so changes in policy have powerful effects on unemployment and real GDP.

We have a comprehensive framework to understand how the aggregate price level and inflation rate move and adjust over time in response to changes in aggregate demand, production relative to potential output, and unem­ ployment relative to its natural rate. There is, however, one loose end. How does one get from the short-run sticky-price patterns of behavior covered in Part 4 to the long-run flexible-price patterns of behavior that were laid out in Part 3?

Between stage 2 and stage 3 unemployment rises further, real GDP falls again, and inflation again rises.

    "\n",
    "1. The location of the Phillips curve is determined by the expected rate of inflation and the natural rate of unemployment (and possibly by current, active supply shocks). In the absence of supply shocks, the Phillips curve passes through the point at which inflation is its expected value and unemployment is its natural rate.\n",
    "2. The slope of the Phillips curve is determined by the degree of price stickiness in the economy. The more sticky are prices, the flatter is the Phillips curve.\n",
    "3. Modern central banks respond to higher-than-desired inflation by raising interest rates, thus reducing output and raising unemployment. This monetary policy reaction function (MPRF) is a powerful stabilizing factor in modern economies.\n",
    "4. The MPRF and Phillips curve can be used to analyze the effect of changes in economic policy on the economy’s inflation and unemployment rates.\n",
    "5. The natural rate of unemployment in the United States has exhibited moderate swings in the past two generations, from perhaps 4.5 percent at the end of the 1950s to perhaps 7 percent at the start of the 1980s, and now down to about 5 percent. Changes in the natural rate of unemployment shift the Phillips curve to the left or right.\n",
    "6. The principal determinant of the expected rate of inflation is the past behavior of inflation. If inflation has been low and steady, expectations are probably static and the expected inflation rate is very low and unchanging. If inflation has been variable but moderate, expectations are probably adaptive and expected inflation is probably simply equal to last year’s inflation. If inflation has been high or moderate but has varied extremely rapidly, then expectations are probably rational and expected inflation is likely to be households’ and businesses’ best guesses of where economic policy is taking the economy. Changes in inflation expectations shift the Phillips curve up or down.\n",
    "7. The best way to gauge how expectations of inflation are formed is to consider the past history of inflation. Would adaptive expectations have provided a significant edge.\n",
    "8. How fast the flexible-price model becomes relevant depends on the type of inflation expectations in the economy. Under static expectations, the flexible-price model never becomes relevant. Under adaptive expectations, the flexprice model becomes relevant gradually, in the long-run. Under rational expectations the long run is now; the flexprice model analysis is relevant always and immediately.\n",

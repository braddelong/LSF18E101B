We do so in this chapter by building an analytical tool called the IS curve, where “IS” stands for “investment-saving.” The IS curve tells us the relationship between total expenditure or real GDP on the one hand and the long-term risky real interest rate on the other. Changes in the interest rate increase or depress investment and gross exports and so move the economy down or up along the IS curve. Changes in businesses’ optimism or pessimism cause increases or decreases in investment unrelated to changes in interest rates, and so shift the entire IS curve itself either out or in.\n",

    "#### 10.1.1.1 The Role of Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis here of the role of investment spending will parallel the earlier analysis carried out in the flexible-price model. The determinants of investment are unchanged: Investment is still determined by (1) a baseline \"animal spirits\" level of investment $ I_o $, (2) a sensitivity of investment to the real interest rate $ I_r $, and (3) the level of the long-term risky real interest rate r. But the kind of equilibrium the economy reaches and the process by which the economy reaches equilibrium are different. Hence the investment function plays a very different role in the two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the flexible-price model, the real interest rate was the market-clearing price. It was pushed up or down by supply and demand to equate the flow of saving into financial markets (from households and businesses, the government, and foreigners) to the flow of investment funding out of financial markets (to finance replacement of depreciated capital and increases in the capital stock). Supply and demand in the loanable funds market determined the interest rate. In the flexible-price model, the level of saving determined the level of investment, and the strength of investment demand determined the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sticky-price model, the interest rate is not set in the loanable funds market. Instead, it is set directly by the central bank or indirectly by the combination of the stock of money and the liquidity preferences of households and businesses. The interest rate then determines the level of investment, which then plays a key role in autonomous spending. Together, autonomous spending and the multiplier determine the level of output.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What happened to equilibrium in the loanable funds market?” you may ask. In a sticky-price model the fact that businesses match the quantity they produce to aggregate demand automatically creates balance in the financial market, no matter what the interest rate. Any interest rate can be an equilibrium interest rate because the inventory-adjustment process has already made saving equal to investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.1.1.2 Sources of Fluctuations in Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluctuations in investment have two sources. Some are triggered by changes in the real interest rate r. A lower real interest rate means higher investment spending, and a higher real interest rate means lower investment spending. Other fluctuations are triggered by shifts in investors’ expectations about future growth, profits, and risk. These two sources of fluctuations in investment correspond, respectively, to changes in investment spending I produced by (1) the interest sensitivity of investment parameter $ I_r $ times changes in r, and (2) changes in the baseline \"animal spirits\" level of investment $ I_o $ in the investment function:\n",

    "\n",
    "A business that undertakes an investment project always has alternative uses for the money. One alternative would be to take the money that would have been spent building the factory or buying the machines and place it instead in the financial markets—that is, lending it out at the market real rate of interest. Thus the opportunity cost of an investment project is the real interest rate. The higher the interest rate, the fewer the number and the smaller the value of investment projects that will return more than their current cost, and the lower the level of investment spending. But which interest rate is the relevant one? There are many different interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.1.2.1 The Real Interest Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate that is relevant for investment spending decisions is not the nominal but the real interest rate. The nominal price a business charges rises with inflation. If a business is willing to invest when the interest rate is 5 percent and inflation is 2 percent per year (and so the real interest rate is 3 percent per year), then the business should also be willing to invest when the interest rate is 10 percent and inflation is 7 percent per year (and so the real interest rate is still 3 percent per year). Figure 10.3 on page 286 shows both nominal and real interest rates in the United States. There is a big difference between the two.\n",

Thus the real interest rate that companies that borrow to finance investment care about is now some 2.5 percentage points below the nominal interest rate. The gap has varied little over the past twenty years because inflation had remained stable and quiescent._\n",

    "\n",
    "The interest rate that is relevant for determining investment spending is a long-term interest rate. Investments are durable and long-lasting. Whenever a manager considers undertaking an investment project, he or she must compare the potential profits from the project to the opportunity to make money from a long-term alternative commitment of the funds elsewhere. The interest rate that is the oppor­ tunity cost of undertaking an investment project with a life length of a decade or more is the interest rate on a long-term loan for a period of a decade or more: the long-term interest rate.\n",

    ">>_**Bond Yield Curves**: The interest rate the U.S. government must pay to borrow money depends on how long it wants to borrow the money. The same applies to private borrowers as well: Usually, the longer the term for which one wishes to borrow, the higher the interest rate one must pay._\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction matters because long- and short-term interest rates are different and do not always move in step. Below is a standard yield curve chart, the term structure of interest rates, that plots the interest rate on safe U.S. government bonds of three different maturities—3-month Treasury bills, 3-year Treasury notes, and 10-year Treasury bonds—at three different moments—1992, 1996, and 2003. Looking at the shifts over time in such a yield curve chart shows that different interest rates do not always fluctuate together. The variable premium in the interest rate that the market charges on long-term loans vis-a-vis short-term loans is called the term premium. This creates the potential for problems for the Federal Reserve: What if it wants to lower interest rates to stimulate investment, and so buys three-month Treasury bills for cash to reduce the short-term interest rate, but finds the term premium rising and thus the long-term interest rate that matters for investment unchanged?\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term interest rates are usually higher than short-term rates because longterm assets are riskier, and investors demand a higher average return to compensate them for bearing this extra risk. When Wall Street bond traders expect short-term interest rates to rise in the future, the term premium is large. When they expect short-term interest rates to fall steeply, the term premium is negative, but such an inverted term premium is rare—the term structure of interest rates or yield curve is almost always upward sloping.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1992 and 2003 the yield curve was steep: long-term loans carried significantly higher interest rates than short-term loans; the term premium was high. In 1996 the yield curve was nearly flat; the term premium was low. In 1992 and 1996 the general levels of interest rates were about the same. By 2003 the general level of interest rates had fallen all across the maturity structure; all three sets of Treasury assets paid lower returns than they had in 1992 or 1996.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why was the term premium so high in 1992 and 2003? Two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in both cases the Federal Reserve had aggressively pushed interest rates down in the recent past to try to boost investment and employment, so short-term interest rates were depressed below their normal levels, and markets were expecting the Federal Reserve to reverse itself as soon as employment returned to normal levels. The term premium is likely to be high when interest rates are expected to rise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, savers and investors in both 1992 and 2003 could look forward to a future in which there were large budget deficits that the government seemed to have no plans for reducing. In the flexible-price model, high budget deficits produce higher than normal interest rates. And so investors were expecting interest rates to soon be not just at normal but at higher than normal runaway-deficit levels.\n",

The representative risky interest rate—that paid by companies rated \"BBB\" by Bank of America Merrill Lynch—(in blue) has, over the past two decades, varied between 1.5 and 7 percentage points more than the safe long-term rate paid by the U.S. government (in red). Lenders ought to charge a risk premium that depends both on their tolerance for risk and on the amount of risk involved when they lend to other organizations. There is no reason why this should be constant.

The yield curve has even become \"inverted\": the long-term rate has fallen below the short-term rate, inevitably because financial markets anticipate that a recession will come soon, and that the central bank will then be frantically cutting interest rates to try to boost investment spending, so now is a good time to buy a long-term Treasury bond to lock in a relatively high return._\n",

    "\n",
    "Lending money to a business always carries an element of risk. Perhaps the borrower will go bankrupt before the loan is due. Perhaps the creditors will find themselves last, or nearly last, in line as a small amount of leftover postbankruptcy assets are divided up. Financial institutions lending money are keenly interested in the financial health of those to whom they lend. The riskier they believe the loan is—the larger the possibility of a bankruptcy or a debt rescheduling appears to be—the higher is the interest rate that lenders will demand to compensate them for risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate that a firm faces is the interest rate charged to risky borrowers, not the interest rate charged to safe borrowers (like the U.S. government) to whom people lend when they want to sleep easily at night. The premium that lenders charge for loans to companies rather than to safe government borrowers is called the risk premium. Financial and economic disturbances, like the default of the Russian government in August 1998 or even more so the financial crisis in late 2008, can cause large and swift moves in the risk premium.  In 1998 the rise in the risk premium was neutralized by the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan, who lowered short-term rates and pledged that he would lower them further and keep them lower longer if that was necessary to keep the spike in the risk premium from raising businesses' borrowing costs. In 2008 the \n",
    "Federal Reserve under Ben Bernanke simply could not lower short-term rates far enough and credibly pledge to keep them lower long enough to neutralize the much larger rise in the risk premium. Hence the 1998 rise in the risk premium imposed no ripples on the rest of the economy, while the 2008 rise in the risk premium was the most destructive economic tsunami since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risky interest rate thus does not always move in step with the safe interest rate. Its swings are much larger than any plausible shifts in the relative or absolute riskiness of a diversified portfolio of loans to and bonds of companies. These swings are large and sudden changes in the \"risk tolerance\" of the market that do not have explanations in terms of rational investors insuring themselves against fundamental risks in the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus—bringing this all together—to determine the level of investment spending, take the baseline level of investment $ I_o $ (determined by businesses’ optimism, expected economic growth, and a bunch of other factors for which the level of the stock market serves as a convenient thermometer). Subtract from this baseline level the interest sensitivity of investment parameter $ I_r $ times the relevant interest rate r expressed in decimal form, so an interest rate of 3 percent is expressed as 0.03. The relevant interest rate must be long-term because most investments are long-term.

Anything that affects how sensitive exports are to the real exchange rate will change the slope of the IS curve. And anything that changes how large a swing in real exchange rates is induced by a change in interest rates will change the slope of the IS curve.\n",

    "##### 10.2.3.1.1 Calculating the Dependence of Aggregate Demand on the Interest Rate: An Example</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate how much a change in the interest rate will shift the equilibrium level of planned expenditure, you need to know four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The marginal propensity to expend (MPE), and thus the multiplier: $ \\mu =  1/(1 — MPE) $.\n",
    "* The interest sensitivity of investment $ I_r $.\n",
    "* How much a change in the interest rate will affect the real exchange rate $ {\\epsilon}_r $.\n",
    "* How much a change in the exchange rate will affect exports $ x_r $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you know that the marginal propensity to expend MPE is 0.5 and the interest sensitivity of investment is 10,000, that is, a 1-percentage-point rise in the annual interest rate (${\\Delta}r = 0.01$) decreases annual investment by 100 billion dollars. Then the direct effects of interest rates on investment coupled with the multiplier would lead you to conclude that a 1-percentage-point increase in the interest rate would decrease equilibrium aggregate demand by 200 billion, acting through the investment channel alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is another channel through which interest rates affect aggregate demand—the export channel. If a 1-percentage-point increase in the interest rate (${\\Delta}r = 0.01$) reduces the value of the exchange rate by 10 units, and if each 1-unit reduction in the exchange rate reduces exports by 500 billion, then there would be an additional decrease of 2 x (500) x (10) x (0.01) = 100 billion in aggregate demand through the exports channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the total decline in aggregate demand would be 300 billion. The slope of the IS curve would be $ {\\Delta}A/{\\Delta}Y $ or -1/30,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.2.3.2 The Position of the IS Curve\n",

    "The position of the IS curve depends on the baseline level of autonomous spending $ A_o $ times the multiplier 1/(1 — MPE).

Whenever the Federal Reserve buys government bonds in return for cash, it increases the total amount of cash in the hands of the public and reserves in the hands of the banking system. Banks with the extra reserves use them to try to increase their deposits. Thus such an expansionary open-market operation increases the economy’s stock of money: It increases the quantity of assets—checking account deposits and cash—that are readily spendable purchasing power.\n",

    ">>_**Open-Market Operations**: The Federal Reserve changes interest rates by changing the quantity of liquid money in the economy through open-market operations: purchases or sales of U.S. government bills, notes, and bonds for cash on the open market._\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks, businesses, and households take a look at the larger quantity of money—wealth in the form of readily spendable purchasing power—that they hold. At the previous level of interest rates this is more money than they want to hold in their portfolios. So households, businesses, and banks try to use this money to buy assets, such as bonds, that pay higher yields than cash. As they do so, they push the price of bonds up and the interest rate down. Thus an expansionary open-market opera­ tion reduces interest rates in the economy. The same process works in reverse to push interest rates up when the Federal Reserve sells bonds for cash on the open market. Box 10.4 shows how central bankers would go about trying to calculate the size of the change in interest rates needed to properly manage the economy.\n",

    "#### 10.3.2.1 Moving Along The IS Curve: An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the staff projections of the Federal Reserve predict that if current policies are continued, real GDP will be only 18 trillion at a time for which estimates of potential output are 19 trillion. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) might well decide that it is time to lower interest rates to close such a “deflationary gap.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose further that the staff estimates that the marginal propensity to expend MPE is 0.5, that a 1-percentage-point fall in the real interest rate (${\\Delta}r = -0.01$) generates an extra 110 billion in annual investment spending and a 5-point rise in the real exchange rate. And that each 1 percentage point rise in the real exchange rate—the value of foreign currency—raises exports by 3 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such estimates of the structure of the economy imply that the slope of the IS curve is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> IS slope = $ - {\\mu}(I_r + x_{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}_r) = (2)(11000 + 1500) = 25000 $\n",
    "\n",
    "So to boost equilibrium national income and product by 500 billion by moving the economy along the IS curve, the real interest rate has to be reduced by 0.02—by 2 percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.3.2.2 Difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempts to control aggregate by manipulating interest rates encounter certain difficulties. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, our knowledge of the structure of the economy is imperfect. Perhaps at any particular moment the slope of the IS curve is half what the Federal Reserve staff believes or is twice what the Federal Reserve staff believes. Second, even when policies do have their expected effects, these effects do not necessarily arrive on schedule. As economist Milton Friedman often said, economic policy works with long and _variable_ lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the interest rates that the Federal Reserve can control are short-term, nominal, safe interest rates. The interest rate that determines where the economy is in equilibrium on the IS curve is the long-term, real, risky interest rate. Even if the government and central bank attain their target interest rate and even if the effects of changes in the interest rate are exactly as predicted and arrive exactly on schedule, there is a lot of potential slippage: Changes in the term premium between short and long interest rates, changes in the rate of inflation, and changes in the risk premium will each carry the economy to a point on the IS curve other than the point that the Federal Reserve wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "What determines the value of the term premium—the gap between short-term and long-term interest rates? A major determinant is expectations of future monetary policy. Long-term interest rates will be high relative to short-term interest rates if people expect short-term interest rates to be raised in the future; long-term interest rates will be low relative to short-term interest rates if people expect short-term rates to be lowered in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "How useful is the IS curve in understanding economic fluctuations in the United States over the past generation or so? If we plot on a graph the points corresponding to the long-term real interest rate and output relative to potential attained by the U.S. economy since 1960, we see that the economy has been all over the map—or at least all over the diagram. Yet we can make sense of what has happened using shifts in and movements along the IS curve. That in fact is what the IS curve is for. It is a useful tool, which is why we have spent so many pages developing it. In the following five subsections we will apply the IS curve to gain insight into business-cycle fluctuations in each of the past four decades as well as the current decade.\n",

    "The late 1960s also saw a movement downward and to the right along the IS curve, as real interest rates declined. In large part real interest rates declined by accident. The Federal Reserve did not fully gauge the amount by which inflation was rising. Rising inflation increased the gap between the nominal interest rates directly controlled by monetary policy and the real interest rates that determine planned expenditure. The Federal Reserve did not recognize this as it was happening and thus allowed real interest rates to drift downward.\n",

As Figure 10.16 shows, from 1977 to 1979 the U.S. economy moved down and to the right along the IS curve. However, the expansion of output beyond potential was accompanied by unexpectedly high and rising inflation. This rise in inflation was further fueled by a supply shock: the sudden rise in oil prices triggered by the Iranian revolution.\n",

    "A sudden shift in Federal Reserve policy occurred in 1979 when Paul Volcker became chair of the Federal Reserve, replacing G. William Miller. Under Miller fighting inflation had been a relatively low priority. Under Volcker fighting inflation became the highest priority of all. The Federal Reserve raised annual real interest rates step-by-step from 1979 to 1982 up to over 10 percent. The increase in real interest rates moved the economy up and to the left along the end-of- the-1970s position of the IS curve: The unemployment rate reached nearly 10 percent in 1982, and real GDP fell to only 94 percent of the economy’s potential output.\n",

The result of these increases in government purchases and cuts in taxes was an enormous government deficit and an outward shift in the IS curve. A simultaneous increase in investor optimism triggered by falling inflation combined with the government’s fiscal stimulus to shift the IS curve outward relative to potential output by at least 4 percent.\n",

    "The Federal Reserve responded to this outward shift in the IS curve by maintaining high real interest rates. It sought in the first half of the 1980s to ensure that the success it had achieved in reducing inflation did not unravel. The Federal Reserve feared that a rapid return of real GDP to potential GDP would put upward pressure on inflation once more—hence the maintenance of high real interest rates to make sure that the large Reagan-era fiscal expansion did not have too great an effect.\n",

They became increasingly optimistic that higher real GDP levels relative to potential would not reignite inflation.

    "The principal maker of economic policy from the late 1980s to the mid 2000s was Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, appointed and reappointed by four successive presidents: Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush. \n",
    "\n",
    "Greenspan is somewhat of a paradox: a Federal Reserve chair whom all trust to be a ferocious inflation fighter, yet one who—in the policies that he has chosen—frequently seemed willing to risk higher inflation in order to achieve higher economic growth or to avoid a recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately after taking office Greenspan faced a challenge: the sudden stock market crash of October 1987. How large an effect would this crash have on planned expenditure? What would it do to investment spending? Would a leftward shift in the IS curve be generated by the sudden change in investors’ expectations about the future that triggered the stock market crash? No one knew If the crash turned out to be the harbinger of a large leftward shift in the IS curve, then an unchang­ ing monetary policy would lead to a significant recession. So the Greenspan-led FOMC lowered interest rates and expanded the monetary base, hoping that this shift in monetary policy would offset any leftward shift in the IS curve and avoid a recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "In point of fact, the stock market crash of 1987 had next to no effect on investment spending or planned expenditure. Economists have still not come up with a convincing story for why its effects were so small. The two years after 1987 saw higher output relative to potential and saw lower unemployment rates. The years between 1987 and 1990 did not see real interest rates rising—as they usually do in the latter stages of an expansion—but real interest rates that were stable or falling.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the unemployment rate fell, inflation accelerated. In 1988 and 1989, inflation moved up from 3 to 4 percent. The Federal Reserve found that it had successfully avoided any chance of a (big) recession in 1988 in the aftermath of the stock market crash, but only at the price of letting inflation rise above 4 percent per year. In the second half of 1990 there came a sudden leftward shift in the IS curve: The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait served as a trigger for firms to reduce investment, as they waited to see whether the world economy was about to experience another long-run upward spike in oil prices. The U.S. economy slid into recession at the end of 1990. The Federal Reserve, worried about the upward creep in inflation in the late 1980s, took no steps to reduce real interest rates as the economy slid into the recession.\n",

    "During the recession, inflation fell to 2 V2 percent. Unemployment rose to a peak of 7.6 percent—in the late spring of 1992, just in time to be salient for the 1992 presidential election. Recovery began in mid-1992.\n",
    "Soon thereafter Greenspan made another decision to risk higher inflation in order to accomplish other goals. In 1993 he signaled that if Congress and the president took significant steps to reduce the budget deficit, then the Federal Reserve would try as best as it could to maintain lower interest rates—a shift in the policy mix that would keep the target level of production and employment unchanged but that with lower interest rates would promise higher investment and faster pro­ ductivity growth: an “investment-led recovery.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This time the gamble turned out extremely well. As fiscal policy tightened in 1994 and beyond, interest rates remained significantly lower than they had been in the 1980s even though output recovered to potential. Moreover, this time there was no significant acceleration of inflation, even though by the end of the 1990s unemployment had fallen to the lowest level in a generation and it seemed as though the economy was above potential output.\n",

    "\n",
    "The end of the 1990s saw the end of the dot-com bubble. The crash of the stock market in 2000 was both cause and consequence of the recognition that investors and businesses had been overly optimistic not about the technology and productivity benefits of the computer revolution, but about the ability of businesses to make profits off of the computer boom. Investment fell sharply in 2000 and 2001, carrying real GDP relative to potential down with it. The recession was given a further impetus by the uncertainty created by the terror attack of September 11, 2001. While real GDP had been some 3 percent above potential output in 1999, by 2001 it was 1 percent below potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The executive branch—the administration of George W. Bush—responded by proposing tax cuts that were poorly crafted to stimulate demand: The bulk of the money went to households for which the marginal propensity to consume was low. Fiscal policy thus did little to move the IS curve back to the right and expand output. The Federal Reserve responded by cutting interest rates severely. Observers even began to fear that the Federal Reserve would run out of room to cut interest rates further, since short-term nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero. But during 2002 and 2003 the Federal Reserve’s easy-money policies were neutralized by further falls in business and investor confidence and a further move to the left in the IS curve. In spite of remarkably expansionary monetary policy, it was only after 2004 that there were signs that the economy was beginning to close the output gap.\n",

The Federal Reserve waited to respond, believing that the economy in 2000 had been running at a rate unsustainable without ris­ ing inflation. But when the Federal Reserve did move, it moved rapidly to reduce interest rates. Before 2004, however, few signs suggested that the reduc­ tion in interest rates and concomitant stimulative budget deficits had done much to keep output from falling even further below potential._\n",

    "The primary reason we are making the sticky price-wages-debt assumption right now is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are sure that it corresponds to reality.\n",
    "2. There is a lot of evidence that prices, wages, and debt are sticky, and that in the short run it is aggregate demand that determines the level of national income and product.\n",
    "3. It is the simplest way to break the flexprice model conclusion that national income and product must always be close to potential output, and we know that conclusion must be broken in any good model.\n",
    "4. It is a legacy left behind from the economics of the 1940s that ought to be dropped.\n",

    "In the flexprice model, whenever national income and product Y was below (or above) potential output Y*, there would be an excess supply (or demand) of savings flowing into financial markets.

    "### From Efficiency to Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "We have our production function, output as a function of the capital stock, the product of the labor force and the efficiency with which that labor can produce, and the single parameter $ \\alpha $ describing how fast diminishing returns to capital set in as the capital-labor ratio increases:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "$ Y = K^{\\alpha}(EL)^{1-\\alpha}  $\n",

    "$ ln(Y) = {\\alpha}(ln(K)) + (1-\\alpha)(EL)  $\n",
    "\n",
    "But what determines the efficiency of labor? Ideas, certainly—the level of technological knowledge in its society; its understanding and ability to implement productive organizations; plus the skills, education, and experience of the workforce. But Malthus's insight was that he needed to focus on the role of resources and, in particular, _resource scarcity_ in limiting the efficiency with which labor can work. Ideas, you see, are non-rival: that one person or group has and is using an idea does not mean another person or group cannot productively use the same idea. The same is not true of natural resources. Natural resources are _rival_: crowd twice as many farmers on the same soil, and their productive efficiency is likely to drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we write the efficiency of labor as a function of society's level of ideas—technology; organizational capability; plus experience, skills, and education—which we will call H, non-rival, and of society's level of resources R divided by the labor force L:\n",

    "With the parameter $ \\gamma $ describing the ratio of the salience of ideas compared to natural resources in generating production efficiency. Why the ratio—and thus all of the $ {\\gamma}/(1-\\gamma) $ terms? Because it will lead to simpler formulas later on, so why not define our production function in terms of it at the start?\n",
    "\n",

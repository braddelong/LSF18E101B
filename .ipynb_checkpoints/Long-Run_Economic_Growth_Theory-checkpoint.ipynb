    "\n",
    "Long-run economic growth is the subject of this Part II of the book. It covers economists' theory of growth. It covers the worldwide pattern of economic growth both across time and across space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Long-run economic growth is the most important topic in macroeconomics. Standards of living in the United States today are at least seven times what they were at the end of the nineteenth century. Successful economic growth has meant that almost all citizens of the United States today live better, and we hope happier, lives than even the rich elite of a century ago. The study of long-run economic growth aims at understanding its sources and causes and at determining what government policies will promote or retard long-run economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-run growth as a module that is not very closely connected to the study of business cycles, recessions, unemployment, inflation, and stabilization policy that makes up the bulk of this book. The models used and the conclusions reached in Part II will by and large not be central to subsequent parts, for starting in Part III we turn to business cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, then, include this Part II? The principal reason is that long-run economic growth is such an important topic.\n",

The most important differences spring from differences in the level of technology and of organization currently used in production, which are themelves the result of differences in the skills of workers, the availability and competence of engineers and engineering knowledge, and the creation and maintenance of organizations with internal structures that impel them toward profductive efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary differences spring from differences in the presence or absence of key natural resources, and in the value of the capital stock—the structures and buildings, machines and programs, and inventories and work flows that have themselves been produced by humans earlier and are necessary for a productive economy.\n",

    "The enormous gaps between the productive potentials of different nations spring from favorable initial conditions and successful growth-promoting economic policies in the United States—and from less favorable initial conditions and less successful subsequent policies in Mexico and downright unsuccessful policies in Nigeria and Afghanistan.\n",

    "Moreover, the bulk of today’s gap between living standards and productivity levels in the United States and Mexico (and Nigeria, and Afghanistan) opened up in the past century and a half; the bulk of success (or failure) at boosting an economy’s productive potential is thus—to a historian at least—of relatively recent origin. A century and a half ago U.S. GDP per capita was four times Afghan, not twenty times. While U.S. productive potential has amplified 13-fold since 1870, Afghan has only amplified two-fold and Nigerian five-fold.

    "### 4.1.2 Factors Determining the Shape of Global Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "The overwhelming bulk of differences in prosperity levels both between countries and across large spans of time are the result of differences in economies’ productive potentials.We classify the most important factors that generate differences in economies’ productive potentials into two broad groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, differences in the economy’s efficiency of labor—how technology is deployed and how organization is used to increase the amount of output a worker can produce with the same amount of capital and other resources. As noted above, these differences are primarily the result of differences in three factors:\n",
    "    * The community of engineering practice\n",
    "    * The skills of workers\n",
    "    * The incentives and efficiency of organizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, differences in how large a multiple of current production has been set aside in the form of useful machines, buildings, and infrastructure to boost the productivity of workers, even with the same technology or organization:\n",
    "    * With differences in natural resources—which are sometimes thought of as separate from and sometimes as a form of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call the first group \"the efficiency of labor\" and the second \"capital intensity\". It has been an important finding by economists over the past three generations that capital and investment have played a substantial role: it is not _all_ increases in knowledge, for increases in thrift and resources have played a substantial role. But it has been an even more important finding that the But an even more important finding is that the lion’s share of economic growth both acroos long spans of time and between countries has come from the factors that affect the efficiency of labor. They are: the advance of knowledge that enables the creation of communities of engineering practice, to diffusion of knowledge and engineering practice, the education and training of workers, and the creation and maintenance of efficient productive organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.2.1 The Efficiency of Labor\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest reason that Americans today are vastly richer and more productive than their predecessors of a century ago is that they have enjoyed an extraordinary ampli  fication of the efficiency of labor. Efficiency has risen for two reasons: advances in technology and in organization. We now know how to make electric motors, dope semiconductors, transmit signals over fiber optics, fly jet airplanes, machine internal combustion engines, build tall and durable structures out of concrete and steel, record entertainment programs on DVDs, make hybrid seeds, fertilize crops with nutrients, organize assembly lines, and do a host of other things our predecessors did not know how to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "These technological advances allow American workers to easily perform value-generating tasks that were unimaginable, or at least extremely difficult to accomplish, a century ago. Moreover, the American economy is equipped to make use of all these technological capabilities. First, we have engineers who understand and can apply modern technologies. There is a very large gap between theoretical knowledge of how the world works and what kinds of things might be possible on the one hand, and actually getting an energy, materials, and machine-based production process working smoothly on the other. An economy that has a large and productive community of engineers with their knowledge and practices will be effective at applying scientific knowledge of how things work and what production processes are conceivable. An economy that does not have such a community of engineering practice does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all the engineering advice and plans turned into blueprints for factory design and manuals for task performance will do no good if the people actually doing the work—the workers—lack the skills and experience to understand and implement them. Education and training are essential components of an economy with a high efficiency of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "And engineers and workers produce little if they are unwilling to work, or if their work is not coordinated. An honest government and a society that rewards productive work—rather than acquisition by fraud or force—is essential. As Adam Smith wrote back in 1776,  The United States today has the forms of business organization, it has the stability and honesty of government, and it has the other socioeconomic institutions needed to successfully utilize modern technology. So it is both better technology and advances in organization that have led to vast increases in the efficiency of labor and thus to American standards of living.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to admit that we economists know less than we should about the processes by which this better technology and these advances in organization come to be. Economists are much better at analyzing the consequences of advances in technology and improvements in organization and other factors that make for a high effi  ciency of labor, but they have less to say about their sources.\n",

Policies that accelerate innovation and diffusion, educate and train workers, improve institutions and so boost the efficiency of labor do the bulk of accelerating economic growth and create prosperity.

    "\n",
    "### 4.2.1 Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.1.1 What Are Economic Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case for all economic models, the Solow growth model consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Variables_: economic quantities of interest that we can calculate and  measure, denoted by letters (or maybe two letters) like L for the number of workers in the labor force or Y for the amount of useful goods and services produced in a year—real GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Behavioral relationships_: relationships that (1) describe how humans, making economic decisions given their opportunities and opportunity costs, decide what to do, and (2) that thus determine the values of the economic variables, represented by equations that have an economic variable on the left hand side and, on the right, a set of factors that determine the value of the variable and a rule of thumb for what that value is currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * _Parameters_: determine which out of a broad family of potential behavioral relations describes the behavior of the particular economic scenario at hand; the ability to work algebraically with parameters allows one to perform an enormous number of potential \"what-if?\" calculations very quickly and in a very small space\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Equilibrium conditions_: conditions that tell us when the economy is in a position of balance, when some subset of the variables are \"stable\"—that is, are either constant are changing in simple and predictable ways, usually represented by solutions of some system of the equations that are behavioral relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Accounting identities_: statements about the relationships between variables that are automatically and necessarily true because of the way the variables are defined, represented by equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.1.2 Keys to the Solow Long-Run Growth Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every economic model has a single key principal economic variable at its heart. We will be most interested in that one variable—the one the model is organized around.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Solow growth model, the key variable is labor productivity: useful production per worker, how much the average worker in the economy is able to produce. We calculate output per worker by simply taking the economy’s level of real GDP or output Y, and dividing it by the economy’s labor force L. Real GDP is the estimated annual value of goods and services produced for final sale: that somebody buys them (or, at least, somebody thinks they will be bought) tells us that they are _useful_. The labor force is the number of workers with or actively looking for jobs. Output per worker, Y/L, is a different concept from output per capita, Y/Pop. Y/Pop is the average income that can be spent to benefit the people, received by them or somebody else. Output per worker Y/L is how much in the way of useful goods and services the aveage worker can produce annually. It is a proxy. Thus it is imperfect. But it is useful because it is a simple proxy for how prosperous an economy is considered as a mechanism for making the things people find necessary, convenient, or luxurious.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every economic model economists proceed with their analysis by looking for an equilibrium: a point of balance, a condition of rest, a state of the system toward which the model will converge over time. Economists look for equilibrium for a simple reason: either an economy is at its (or one of its) equilibrium position(s), or it is moving—and probably (or hopefully?) moving rapidly—to an equilibrium position. The Solow growth model is no exception—\n",
    "\n",

These are captured by the current value of the efficiency of labor E. This average worker also uses an average share of the economy’s capital stock, which variable we will denote by \"K\".

    "1. A one percent increase in the capital at the disposal of the average worker—a one percent increase in K/L—will carry with it the same proportional increase in the level of labor productivity—of output per worker Y/L—with a factor of proportionality we will call α, a number between 1 and 0 that serves as a gauge of how quickly opportunities to amplify productivity via using more structures and machines are exhausted, and how rapidly diminishing returns set in. (Note that, when we apply the Solow growth model, different economies will have different values of α; the same economy may well have a different value of α at different times; and asking \"what would happen if the value of the factor of proportionality α were different?\" is one of the principal what-if questions and exercises we will want to undertake and analyze.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A one percent increase in how well technology and organization are used to boost the productivity of the average worker—a one percent increase in the _efficiency of labor_, which we will label E—will carry with it a 1 - α percent increase in the level of labor productivity—of output per worker Y/L. This is best thought of as a definition of what we mean by the _efficiency of labor_ E. (And why the same α here as in the first rule of thumb? Because it makes the ultimate equations we will work with in the model simpler, and it is harder to make mistakes when things are simple. \n",

These conditions, both of them, (a) are very reasonable rules of thumb, and (b) make our calculations much simpler and easier to understand. We can then give quantitative answers to any questions we are asked about the effects of changes in economic policy and the economic environment on economic growth, and those answers will depend solely on (a) how policy and the environment shift the values of K/L and E, and (b) the value of the economy's factor of proportionality α.\n",

That is, α measures how fast diminishing returns to investment set in in the economy. A value of α near zero means that the extra amount of output made possible by an additional unit of capital declines very quickly as the capital stock rises. A value of α near 1 means that each additional unit of capital makes possible almost as large an increase in output as the last additional unit. As α varies from a high number near 1 to a low number near 0, the force of diminishing returns to investment gets stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of illustrating this point in algebra is to use a little calculus to calculate the marginal product of capital, the MPK: how much total output increases as a result of a one-unit increase in the capital stock, dY/dK. For the Cobb-Douglas production function:\n",

All five of the alternative production functions are calibrated so that the level of output per worker Y/L is 40 when the capital-labor ratio K/L is 200. Take away from this graph the flexibility of the Cobb-Douglas production function. It can be used to analyze economies in which the profits from investment and the boost to labor productivity from increasing the capital stock is high.

    "#### 4.2.3.1 A Glance at Some Details\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part III and Part IV we will talk in detail about the circular-flow relationship you learned in your principles of cconomics class: Total production—the amount of output an economy produces—equals aggregate demand—total spending—equals national income. So we use the variable for Y for all three. The most commonly-used measure of this circular flow of economic activity is Gross Domestic Product, abbreviated \"GDP\". But that is the same thing as aggregate demand (which we will write \"AD\" on those rare occasions when we want to distinguish total spending from national income and product). And those are the same thing as national income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Y_national income and product, aggregate demand—is divided into four parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "* consumption spending C, \n",
    "* investment spending I, \n",
    "* government purchases G, and \n",
    "* net exports NX, which equal gross exports minus imports, NX = GX — IM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Society can spend its national income on consumption goods and government purchases, or income can be saved. Total savings directed at the domestic economy has three components: private—business and household—saving $ S^p = Y - C - T $ where T are total net taxes collected by the government, government saving $ S^g = T - G$, and saving from foreigners directed at the domestic economy $ S^f = - NX $. Note well: savings that actually occur _ex post_ and are translated into investment that increases the capital stock may well not be equal to what people had planned to save _ex ante_. This will matter at lot in Part IV\n",
    "\n",
    "But none of that is of the essence here. The details of saving and the circular flow are not our concern—yet.\n",

    "#### 4.2.3.2 Ruthless Simplification: The Savings-Investment Rate s\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will follow economists' custom of ruthless simplification, assume that the workings of the circular flow are unproblematic, and assume that total domestic saving S is equal to a constant parameter s times real GDP Y.

The background assumption, however—made because it makes formulas much simpler—will be that s will remain at its current value as far as we look into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call s the economy’s saving rate or, more completely, its saving-investment rate (to remind us that s is measuring both the flow of saving into the economy’s financial markets and also the share of total production that is invested and used to build up and increase the economy’s capital stock).\n",

    "Adopt the convention of using a subscript when we need to identify the year to which we are referring. K<sub>0</sub> denotes the capital stock at some initial year, usually the year at which we begin the analysis; K<sub>3</sub> denotes the capital stock three years after the year at which we begin the analysis; K<sub>2003</sub> means the capital stock in 2003; K<sub>t</sub> denotes the capital stock when some year t is the current year; K<sub>t+1</sub> denotes the capital stock in the year after the current year; and K<sub>t-1</sub> means the capital stock in the year before the current year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, investment makes the capital stock tend to grow. But investment is not the only factor that changes the capital stock. There is depreciation. Over time depreciation makes the capital stock tend to shrink—old capital becomes obsolete, or breaks, or simply wears out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you will hear people refer to the change in the capital stock as net investment—investment net of depreciation—and refer to the amount of plant and equipment purchased and installed as gross investment.

    "How does the model behave if we relax those unrealistic assumptions, and incorporate labor force and efficiency of labor growth? We can see the same way we saw above: assume various parameter values and initial conditions, and see what happens. Back when Robert Solow originally developed his model, computer time was so expensive that the only way to gain understanding was to solve the algebra and then think. Now, however, (as long as our programs run without bugs) we can directly see. Now look at the behavior of the model for the same parameter values as above, only with labor force growth at 1% per year and labor efficiency growth at 2% per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time the economy does not stagnate: there is no tendency for the economy's level of output or of output per worker or of the capital stock to head for some asymptote where they then stick. And there should not be. This model was built to understand the ongoing and—so far—fairly constant proportional growth that modern industrial economies have experienced since the Industrial Revolution. If our model predicted some eventual cessation of growth and subsequent stagnation, either we would have been doing it wrong, or it would be huge news. Indeed, there is no reason for output per worker to stagnate: labor is becoming more efficient and productive, and the other productive resource in the economy is capital, which is something labor can and does create. And with both efficiency and with both labor efficiency and the labor force increasing, there is no reason for output growth to approach any end. And with output increasing and savings a constant share of output, we would expect the capital stock to grow too.\n",

    "Earlier, when we had assumed that labor force and efficiency were both constant, and thus that n and g were both equal to 0, our equilibrium condition was K/Y = s/δ. Since the saving-investment rate s and the depreciation rate δ were both constant, our equilibrium condition required that the capital-output ratio K/Y be constant as well. There was where the economy was in equilibrium, in balance, with a stable level of not only the capital-output ratio but of the capital stock and output as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have added more realism back into our model by allowing the labor force and labor efficiency to both increase over time, at their constant rates n and g. This should, one would think, change how the economy behaves—and it would change the equilibrium condition that we look at to understand in which directions the economic variables of interest are changing.\n",

    "What effect does this added realism—allowing n and g to take on values other than 0—have on our equilibrium condition that the capital-output ratio be stable?\n",
    "\n",
    "In an important sense: None! Our equilibrium condition is, in a sense, the same: that the capital-output ratio be constant. But this time, when the capital-output ratio is constant the economy's equilibrium is not one of stable and stagnant balance but rather one of _balanced growth_. Output per worker is then growing at the same rate as the capital stock per worker. Output is growing and the same rate as the capital stock. The former two per worker variables are in balance, and they are both growing at the same rate as the efficiency of labor. The latter two economy-wide aggregate variables are in balance, and they are growing at the same rate as the sum of labor efficiency growth and labor force growth.\n",

    "This is a good place to introduce four mathematical rules of thumb to make life easier. They are all only approximations. But they are good enough for our purposes. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The growth-of-a-product rule**: The growth rate of a product is equal to the sum of the growth rates of its components. Since total output Y is equal to output per worker Y/L times the number of workers L, the growth rate of total output Y will be equal to the growth rate of Y/L plus the growth rate of L: $ g_Y = g_{(Y/L)} + g_L $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The growth-of-a-quotient rule**: The proportional change of a quotient is equal to the difference between the proportional changes of its components. Since capital per worker K/L is equal to the quotient of capital K and the number of workers L, its growth rate will be the difference between their growth rates: $ g_{(K/L)} = g_K - g_L $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The growth-of-a-power rule**: The proportional change of a quantity raised to a power is equal to the proportional change in the quantity times the power to which it is raised. For example, suppose that we have a situation in which output per worker Y/L is equal to the capital stock per worker K/L raised to raised to the power $\\alpha$ times some constant E: $ Y/L = (K/L)^{\\alpha}E $. Then because the growth rate of E is zero and becasue of the growth-of-a-power rule the growth rate of Y will be equal to $ \\alpha $ times the growth rate of K: $ g_{(Y/L)} = {\\alpha}g_{(K/L)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The rule of 72**: A quantity growing at k percent per year doubles in 72/k years. A quantity shrinking at k percent per year halves itself in 72/k years.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may hear people say that a background in calculus is needed to understand intermediate macroeconomics. That is not true. These four mathematical rules of thumb contain 95 percent of what calculus is used for in intermediate macro economics. (Of course, you do need calculus if you want to do more than just take them on faith, and instead have a deep understanding of just why these rules of thumb work.)\n",

    "But at what value will the economy’s capital-output ratio be constant? Here is where allowing n and g to take on values other than 0 matters. The capital-output ratio will be constant—and therefore we’ll be in balanced-growth equilibrium — when K/Y = s/(n + g + δ). Add up the economy’s labor-force growth rate, efficiency-of-labor growth rate, and depreciation rate; divide the saving-investment rate by that sum; and that is your balanced-growth equilibrium capital-output ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is s/(n + g + δ) the capital-output ratio in equilibrium? Think of it this way: Suppose the economy is in balanced growth. How much is it investing? There must be investment equal to δK to replace depreciated capital. There must be investment equal to nK to provide the extra workers in the labor force, which is expanding at rate n, with the extra capital they will need. And, since the efficiency of labor is growing at rate g, there must be investment equal to gK in order for the capital stock to keep up with increasing efficiency of labor.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a condition for capital and output to be in balance—for savings at that capital-output ratio to be such so to equal the investment requirements for capital and output to grow at the same rate.

    "\n",
    "This is thus the balanced-growth equilibrium condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it is attained, what the capital-output ratio K/Y will be is constant because s, n, g, and δ are all constant. So when there is balanced growth—when output per worker Y/L and capital per worker K/L are growing at the same rate—the capital-output ratio K/Y will be constant. If the capital-output ratio K/Y is lower than s/(n + g + &delta;), then depreciation (&delta;K) plus the amount (n + g)K that capital needs to grow to keep up with growing output will be less than investment (sY), so the capital-output ratio will grow. It will keep growing until K/Y reaches s/(n + g + &delta;). If the capital-output ratio K/Y is greater than s/(n + g + &delta;), then depreciation (&delta;K) plus the amount (n + g)K that capital needs to grow to keep up with growing output will be greater than investment (sY), so the capital-output ratio will shrink.

    "In economic terms, the balanced-growth equilibrium capital-output ratio is equal to the share of production that is saved and invested for the future—the economy’s saving-investment rate s—divided by the sum of three things:\n",

    "* The growth rate of the labor force n.\n",
    "* The growth rate of the efficiency of labor g.\n",
    "* The depreciation rate δ at which capital breaks down and wears out.\n",

    "We’ll sometimes call s/(n + g + δ) the “equilibrium” capital-output ratio, and we’ll sometimes call it the “balanced-growth” capital-output ratio. To be always saying “balanced-growth equilibrium” capital-output ratio is too much of a mouthful.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know K/Y = s/(n + g + δ) gives us balanced growth, where capital per worker K/L and output per worker Y/L grow at the same rate? \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the current capital-output ratio is lower than s/(n + g + δ). Then (n + g + δ)K would be less than the economy’s total investment which is equal to sY, the saving rate s times the level of output Y. Thus saving and investment will more than provide new workers with the capital they need to be fully productive, more than cover the increase in output due to the increase in labor efficiency, and more than com  pensate for the wearing out of capital through depreciation. The capital stock would grow faster than n + g. Since n + g is the rate at which output grows, the capital-output ratio would rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose instead the current capital-output ratio were above s/(n + g + δ). Then sY will be less then the economy’s total investment sY will be insufficient to keep the capital stock growing at rate n + g. And since n + g is the rate at which output grows, the capital-output ratio will fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus a capital-output ratio greater than s/(n + g + δ) makes the capital-output ratio fall. And a capital-output ratio less than s/(n + g + δ) makes the capital- output ratio rise. So a capital-output ratio equal to s/(n + g + δ) is indeed the balanced-growth equilibrium condition.\n",

    "We now see how capital intensity and technological and organizational progress drive economic growth. Capital intensity—the economy’s capital-output ratio—determines what is the multiple of the current efficiency of labor E that balanced-growth path output per worker Y/L is. Things that increase capital intensity—raise the capital-output ratio—make balanced-growth output per worker a higher multiple of the efficiency of labor. Thus they make the economy richer. Things that reduce capital intensity make balanced-growth output per worker a lower multiple of the efficiency of labor, and so make the economy poorer.\n",

    "Suppose that α is 1/2, so that α/(l—α) is 1, and that s is equal to three times n + g + δ, so that the balanced-growth capital-output ratio is 3. Then balanced-growth output per worker is simply equal to three times the efficiency of labor. If we consider another economy with twice the saving rate s, its balanced-growth capital-output ratio is 6, and its balanced-growth level of output per worker is twice as great a multiple of the level of the efficiency of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher is the parameter α—that is, the slower diminishing returns to investment set in—the stronger is the effect of changes in the economy’s balanced-growth capital intensity on the level of output per worker, and the more important are thrift and investment incentives and other factors that influence s relative to those that influence the efficiency of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose that the balanced-growth capital-output ratio is 4. Then if α is 1/3, α/(1—α) is 1/2, and the balanced-growth path level of output per worker is twice the level of the efficiency of labor, as you then multiply the efficiency of labor by the square root of the capital-output ratio. Most economists think that 1/3 is a reasonable parameter value for the United States today.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By contrast, if α is 1/2, α/(l—α) is equal to 1, and again with a balanced-growth capital-output ratio of 4, the level of output per worker is fully four times the level of the efficiency of labor, as you then multiply the efficiency of labor by the capital-output ratio.. Most economists think that 1/2 is a reasonable parameter value for the United States a century ago or for relatively poor countries today.\n",
    "\n",
    "* But some economists—for example, Paul Romer, currently of the World Bank—believe that the evidence points at still higher values of α. If α = 2/3, and again with a balanced-growth capital-output ratio of 4, the level of output per worker is fully sixteen times the level of the efficiency of labor, as you then multiply the efficiency of labor by the square of the capital-output ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note—this is important-that changes in the economy’s capital intensity shift the balanced-growth path up or down to a different multiple of the efficiency of labor, but the growth rate of Y/L along the balanced-growth path is simply the rate of growth g of the efficiency of labor E. The material standard of living grows at the same rate as labor efficiency. \n",

    "This is what tells us that technology, organization, worker skills, education—all those things that increase the efficiency of labor and keep on increasing it—are likely to be ultimately more important to growth in output per worker than saving and investment. The U.S. economy experienced a large increase in its capital-output ratio in the late nineteenth century. It may be experiencing a similar increase now, as we invest more and more in computers. But the Gilded Age industrialization came to an end, and the information technology revolution will run its course. Aside from these episodes, it is growth in the efficiency of labor E that sustains and accounts for the lion’s share of long-run economic growth.\n",

    "To see how to use the expression for output per worker when the economy is on its balanced-growth path, let’s work through an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the economy’s labor-force growth rate n is 1 percent per year, the efficiency-of-labor growth rate g is 2 percent per year, and the depreciation rate δ is 3 percent per year. Suppose further that the diminishing-returns-to-investment parameter α is 1/2, and the economy’s saving-investment rate s is 18 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the balanced-growth equilibrium capital-output ratio s/(n + g + δ) equals 3, and α/(l—α) equals 1. Substituting these values into equation (4.3.8) above:\n",

When the efficiency of labor is 10,000 per year, balanced-growth output per worker is 30,000 per year. When the efficiency of labor rises to 20,000 per year, balanced- growth output per worker rises to 60,000 per year.\n",

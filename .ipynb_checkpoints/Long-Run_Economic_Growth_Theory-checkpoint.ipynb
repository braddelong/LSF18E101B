    "\n",
    "Long-run economic growth is the subject of this Part II of the book. It covers economists' theory of growth. It covers the worldwide pattern of economic growth both across time and across space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Long-run economic growth is the most important topic in macroeconomics. Standards of living in the United States today are at least seven times what they were at the end of the nineteenth century. Successful economic growth has meant that almost all citizens of the United States today live better, and we hope happier, lives than even the rich elite of a century ago. The study of long-run economic growth aims at understanding its sources and causes and at determining what government policies will promote or retard long-run economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-run growth as a module that is not very closely connected to the study of business cycles, recessions, unemployment, inflation, and stabilization policy that makes up the bulk of this book. The models used and the conclusions reached in Part II will by and large not be central to subsequent parts, for starting in Part III we turn to business cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, then, include this Part II? The principal reason is that long-run economic growth is such an important topic.\n",

    "\n",
    "At most a trivial part of them are due to whether unemployment in a country is currently above or below its average level, or whether various bad macroeconomic policies are currently disrupting the functioning of the price system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overwhelming bulk of these differences are the result of differences in economies’ productive potentials. The most important differences spring from differences in the level of technology and of organization currently used in production, which are themelves the result of differences in the skills of workers, the availability and competence of engineers and engineering knowledge, and the creation and maintenance of organizations with internal structures that impel them toward profductive efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary differences spring from differences in the presence or absence of key natural resources, and in the value of the capital stock—the structures and buildings, machines and programs, and inventories and work flows that have themselves been produced by humans earlier and are necessary for a productive economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enormous gaps between the productive potentials of different nations spring from favorable initial conditions and successful growth-promoting economic policies in the United States—and from less favorable initial conditions and less successful subsequent policies in Mexico and downright unsuccessful policies in Nigeria and Afghanistan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the bulk of today’s gap between living standards and productivity levels in the United States and Mexico (and Nigeria, and Afghanistan) opened up in the past century and a half; the bulk of success (or failure) at boosting an economy’s productive potential is thus—to a historian at least—of relatively recent origin. A century and a half ago U.S. GDP per capita was four times Afghan, not twenty times. While U.S. productive potential has amplified 13-fold since 1870, Afghan has only amplified two-fold and Nigerian five-fold. (Do, however, note that life expectancies at birth have more than doubled everywhere: humanity has done better at distributing the technologies that reduce infant mortality and enable longer life expectancy across the globe than it has done at distributing the technologies that boost production.\n",

    "### 4.1.2 Factors Determining the Shape of Global Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "The overwhelming bulk of differences in prosperity levels both between countries and across large spans of time are the result of differences in economies’ productive potentials.We classify the most important factors that generate differences in economies’ productive potentials into two broad groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, differences in the economy’s efficiency of labor—how technology is deployed and how organization is used to increase the amount of output a worker can produce with the same amount of capital and other resources. As noted above, these differences are primarily the result of differences in three factors:\n",
    "    * The community of engineering practice\n",
    "    * The skills of workers\n",
    "    * The incentives and efficiency of organizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, differences in how large a multiple of current production has been set aside in the form of useful machines, buildings, and infrastructure to boost the productivity of workers, even with the same technology or organization:\n",
    "    * With differences in natural resources—which are sometimes thought of as separate from and sometimes as a form of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call the first group \"the efficiency of labor\" and the second \"capital intensity\". It has been an important finding by economists over the past three generations that capital and investment have played a substantial role: it is not _all_ increases in knowledge, for increases in thrift and resources have played a substantial role. But it has been an even more important finding that the But an even more important finding is that the lion’s share of economic growth both acroos long spans of time and between countries has come from the factors that affect the efficiency of labor. They are: the advance of knowledge that enables the creation of communities of engineering practice, to diffusion of knowledge and engineering practice, the education and training of workers, and the creation and maintenance of efficient productive organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.2.1 The Efficiency of Labor\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest reason that Americans today are vastly richer and more productive than their predecessors of a century ago is that they have enjoyed an extraordinary ampli  fication of the efficiency of labor. Efficiency has risen for two reasons: advances in technology and in organization. We now know how to make electric motors, dope semiconductors, transmit signals over fiber optics, fly jet airplanes, machine internal combustion engines, build tall and durable structures out of concrete and steel, record entertainment programs on DVDs, make hybrid seeds, fertilize crops with nutrients, organize assembly lines, and do a host of other things our predecessors did not know how to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "These technological advances allow American workers to easily perform value-generating tasks that were unimaginable, or at least extremely difficult to accomplish, a century ago. Moreover, the American economy is equipped to make use of all these technological capabilities. First, we have engineers who understand and can apply modern technologies. There is a very large gap between theoretical knowledge of how the world works and what kinds of things might be possible on the one hand, and actually getting an energy, materials, and machine-based production process working smoothly on the other. An economy that has a large and productive community of engineers with their knowledge and practices will be effective at applying scientific knowledge of how things work and what production processes are conceivable. An economy that does not have such a community of engineering practice does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all the engineering advice and plans turned into blueprints for factory design and manuals for task performance will do no good if the people actually doing the work—the workers—lack the skills and experience to understand and implement them. Education and training are essential components of an economy with a high efficiency of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "And engineers and workers produce little if they are unwilling to work, or if their work is not coordinated. An honest government and a society that rewards productive work—rather than acquisition by fraud or force—is essential. As Adam Smith wrote back in 1776,  The United States today has the forms of business organization, it has the stability and honesty of government, and it has the other socioeconomic institutions needed to successfully utilize modern technology. So it is both better technology and advances in organization that have led to vast increases in the efficiency of labor and thus to American standards of living.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to admit that we economists know less than we should about the processes by which this better technology and these advances in organization come to be. Economists are much better at analyzing the consequences of advances in technology and improvements in organization and other factors that make for a high effi  ciency of labor, but they have less to say about their sources.\n",

    "\n",

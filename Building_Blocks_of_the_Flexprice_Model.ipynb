    "In this part we shift our point of view and take a \"snapshot\" of the economy, looking at it over such a short period that its productive resources are fixed but such a long period that wages and prices are fully flexible:\n",

    "* The \"classical\" assumption\n",

    "    * As a baseline and a benchmark\n",
    "    * If the economy does not suffer big shocks for a while (five years?), it may apply\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, the key questions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the economic forces that keep real GDP at its equilibrium value? \n",
    "* And in an economy with flexible wages and prices what determines the division of real GDP among:\n",
    "    * consumption spending, \n",
    "    * investment spending, \n",
    "    * government purchases, and \n",
    "    * net exports?\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3 contains three chapters. Chapter 6 assembles the building blocks. It analyzes the determinants of the components of spending that make up GDP. The answers to the questions above are the same whether prices are flexible (Part 3) or sticky (as they will be in Part 4). So our building blocks form the basis for both our long-run and our short-run stories. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 7 these building blocks are put together. Chapter 7 demonstrates how to use the flexible-price model to analyze the composition of real GDP, and how a flexible-price macroeconomy reacts to disturbances and shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 8 turns the focus of attention from production to the price level. It performs the straightforward task of analyzing the determinants of the price level and inflation in the flexible-price model.\n",

    "* What keeps the economy at full employment when wages and prices are flexible?\n",
    "* What determines the level of consumption spending? What determines the level of investment spending? What determines the level of net exports?\n",
    "* What determines the level of the real exchange rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "**potential output**: The level at which national product would be if all resources were fully employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**production function**: The relationship between the total amount of output produced in an economy and the quantities of labor and capital and the levels of technology and organization used to produce it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**classical assumption**: The assumption that wages and prices and debts are flexible, and respond quickly to always balance supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**labor market**: The market in which workers are hired by firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**marginal product of labor (MPL)**: The increase in potential output from a 1-unit increase in the quantity of labor employed by the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous two chapters we looked at long-run growth—at how the econ­ omy develops and evolves over periods as long as generations. In this chapter we look at the economy over such a short period that its productive resources are fixed but such a long period that wages and prices are fully flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter, Chapter 6, first answers the question: What are the economic forces that keep real GDP at its equilibrium value? In Section 6.1 we show that if wages and prices are flexible enough (as we assume they are here in Part 3), then markets clear: Quantities demanded are equal to quantities supplied. In particular, the labor market clears: Employment is equal to the labor force (save for some “frictional” unemployment), and production is equal to potential output. Should production not be equal to potential output, rising or falling real wages will quickly lower or raise firms’ demands for labor and bring the economy back to equilib­ rium at full employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this chapter assembles the building blocks we need for nearly every remaining chapter in the book. How do consumers decide on consumption spending—how much to spend on themselves and their households? How do businesses decide on the level of investment spending? How are net exports determined? The answers to these questions are the same whether prices are flexible (Part 3) or sticky (as they will be in Part 4 of this book). So our building blocks form the basis for both our long-run and short-run stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word is needed about the flexible-price \"classical\" assumption made in this part. Part 3 answers the first question above in the case where wages and prices are flexible, in which the market system works well, in which markets clear—every buyer finds a willing seller and every seller finds a willing buyer. This means, most important, that labor supply equals demand: No firms wanting to hire workers are left unsatisfied, and no workers willing to work are left permanently unemployed. In Part 4 we will drop this flexible-price full-employment assumption. From Part 4 on, we will instead make the “Keynesian” assumption that wages and prices and debts are sticky. This leads to a number of important differences in the analysis: the market system does not work perfectly, or even well; real GDP is not always equal to potential output; and unemployment can rise high enough to become a critical economic problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Potential Output and Real Wages\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption that wages and prices are flexible was commonly made by the classical economists, who wrote before World War II. Thus this assumption is also called the classical assumption. The classical assumption guarantees that markets work—that prices adjust rapidly to eliminate gaps between the quantities demanded and the quantities supplied. No businesses find their inventories of unsold goods piling up, and there is full employment: Everyone who wants a job (at the market-clearing level of wages) can get a job. Every business that wants to hire a worker (at the market-clearing level of wages) can hire a worker. Thus actual output is equal to potential output: There is no gap between the economy’s pro­ ductive potential and the level of output the economy produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classical assumption that we make in this part of the book is not always, indeed not often, a good one. Experience has shown that a market economy does not always have flexible prices. Prices and wages turn out to be sticky, or sluggish, or stuck. Thus the economy does not always work well, and does not always provide full employment. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the classical flexible-price assumption is not always a good one to make, why make it at all? First, it can be a very good assumption if conditions are right. It is a good assumption if wages and prices are relatively flexible, and if we are look­ ing at processes that take enough time for prices in all of the economy’s markets to adjust in order to balance supply and demand. Second, starting with the classical assumption makes this course easier. It simplifies the analysis of several issues and facilitates an understanding of how the macroeconomy works in the long run. One habit of economists is to start with the simpler cases, and only after they are well understood, to look at more complicated ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the way an economy functions under the flexible-price assumption provides a useful baseline against which to assess economic performance. If we want to assess the costs to society of sticky prices and periods of high unemployment, we need a benchmark against which to make comparisons, and the behavior of the economy in the flexible-price model provides such a benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we must remember that Part 3 presents only one model of the economy. The Keynesian sticky-price model behaves very differently in a number of ways. So Part 3 does not tell the full story.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.1 The Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the flexible-price model of the macroeconomy, two sets of factors determine the levels of potential output and of real wages: the production function and the balance of supply and demand in the labor market. Once we have determined potential output—the economy’s full-employment productive potential—we then know what its actual level of output is, for in the flexible-price model potential output and actual output are the same. Why are they the same? We will see shortly that it is the flexibility of prices and wages that guarantees that potential output and the actual level of output are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4 introduced the production function, the rule that tells us how much the economy can produce given its available productive resources. In the Cobb-Douglas form of the production function, as we learned, potential output Y* is determined by the size of the labor force L, the economy’s capital stock K, the efficiency of labor E, and a parameter $ \\alpha $ between 0 and 1 that tells us the extent to which growth is oriented toward investment, or how fast returns to investment diminish as the capital-output ration increases. A high value of $ \\alpha $ tells us that diminishing returns to investment set in only slowly; hence growth is oriented more toward investment and less toward improvements in the efficiency of labor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The production function tells us that potential output Y* is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ Y* = K^{\\alpha}(LE)^{1-\\alpha} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph below shows us just one slice of this production function for one particular value of the efficiency of labor E and one particular value of the labor force L—the relationship between the capital stock K and potential output Y*. It holds the supply of labor L and the efficiency of labor E fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://delong.typepad.com/.a/6a00e551f080038834022ad39b8215200d-pi\" alt=\"DeLong Olney 2nd ed chs 6 8 pdf page 5 of 94\" title=\"DeLong-Olney-2nd-ed-chs-6-8_pdf__page_5_of_94_.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"429\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">_**The Production Function**: Holding the labor force and the efficiency of labor constant, real GDP in­ creases as the capital stock increases. Because each successive addition to the capital stock produces a smaller increase in output, the production function is curved. The smaller the level of a, the greater the curvature and the more rapidly the returns to in­ vestment diminish._</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In our economic growth chapters, we were looking at changes over time. In this chapter we are looking at the economy at one instant, and we will be comparing alternative and counterfactual scenarios—not over time, as it grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.2 The Labor Market\n",
    "\n",
    "When markets work well, what keeps the economy at full employment and actual production equal to potential output? One way to look at this issue is that the answer lies in the adjustment of prices and supply and demand in the labor market. When the supply of and demand for labor balance, real GDP will equal potential output.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1.2.1 Labor Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists try to suppress every detail and difference that does not matter for the overall result in order to simplify the analysis and focus it on the important factors—the ones that really count. Because differences between businesses will not matter, let uss think about an economy with K typical—identical—representative firms, each of which owns 1 unit of the economy’s capital stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these firms hires a number of workers—let’s call the number of workers each firm hires $ L_{firm} $. Each of these firm in the economy pays each worker the same nominal wage W. Each firm sells $ Y_{firm} $ units of its product at a per-unit price P. The typical firm does not control either the wages it must pay or the prices it receives; those are determined by the market, and each firm takes the wages and prices it is offered. And each firm tries to make as much profit as it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we have a very simple and standard supply-and-demand model of a typical firm. The firm’s profits are simply its revenues minus its costs, and its only costs are the wages it pays to workers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ Profits = Revenues - Costs = PY_{firm} - WL_{firm} $\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out how many workers to hire in order to maximize its profits, the firm must:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Balanced-growth path**: The path toward which total output per worker tends to converge, as the capital-output ratio converges to its equilibrium value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capital intensity**: The ratio of the capital stock to total potential output, K/Y, which describes the extent to which capital, as opposed to labor, is used to produce goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divergence**: The tendency for a per capita measurement such as income or standard of living in various countries to become less equal over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demographic transition**: A period in history which sees first a rise and then a fall in birth rates and a sharp fall in death rates as material standards of living increase above \"subsistence\" levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency of labor**: The skills and education of the labor force, the ability of the labor force to handle modern technologies, and the efficiency with which the economy's businesses and markets function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industrial Revolution**: The transformation of the British economy between 1750 and 1850 when, due to technological advances, largely handmade production was replaced by machine-made production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-run economic growth**: The process by which productivity, living standards, and output increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Malthusian age**:\n",
    "A period in which natural-resource scarcity limits any gains from increases in technology; a larger population becomes poor and malnourished, lowering their standard of living, and ultimately lowering population growth to near zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patent laws and copyrights**: Laws designed to encourage invention and innovation by providing the right to exclude anyone else from using a discovery (patent) or intellectual property (copyright) for a period of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Productivity growth**: The rate at which the economy's full-employment productivity expands from year to year as technology advances, as human capital increases, and as investment increases the economy's physical capital stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Productivity growth slowdown**: The period from 1973 to about 1995 when the rate of productivity growth in the United States and other economies suddenly slowed, for still mysterious reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Saving rate**: The share of total GDP that an economy saves, s, equal to the sum of household, government, and foreign saving divided by total output.\n",

    "\n",
    "Long-run economic growth is the subject of this Part II of the book. It covers economists' theory of growth. It covers the worldwide pattern of economic growth both across time and across space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Long-run economic growth is the most important topic in macroeconomics. Standards of living in the United States today are at least seven times what they were at the end of the nineteenth century. Successful economic growth has meant that almost all citizens of the United States today live better, and we hope happier, lives than even the rich elite of a century ago. The study of long-run economic growth aims at understanding its sources and causes and at determining what government policies will promote or retard long-run economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-run growth as a module that is not very closely connected to the study of business cycles, recessions, unemployment, inflation, and stabilization policy that makes up the bulk of this book. The models used and the conclusions reached in Part II will by and large not be central to subsequent parts, for starting in Part III we turn to business cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, then, include this Part II? The principal reason is that long-run economic growth is such an important topic.\n",

The most important differences spring from differences in the level of technology and of organization currently used in production, which are themelves the result of differences in the skills of workers, the availability and competence of engineers and engineering knowledge, and the creation and maintenance of organizations with internal structures that impel them toward profductive efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary differences spring from differences in the presence or absence of key natural resources, and in the value of the capital stock—the structures and buildings, machines and programs, and inventories and work flows that have themselves been produced by humans earlier and are necessary for a productive economy.\n",

    "The enormous gaps between the productive potentials of different nations spring from favorable initial conditions and successful growth-promoting economic policies in the United States—and from less favorable initial conditions and less successful subsequent policies in Mexico and downright unsuccessful policies in Nigeria and Afghanistan.\n",

    "Moreover, the bulk of today’s gap between living standards and productivity levels in the United States and Mexico (and Nigeria, and Afghanistan) opened up in the past century and a half; the bulk of success (or failure) at boosting an economy’s productive potential is thus—to a historian at least—of relatively recent origin. A century and a half ago U.S. GDP per capita was four times Afghan, not twenty times. While U.S. productive potential has amplified 13-fold since 1870, Afghan has only amplified two-fold and Nigerian five-fold.

    "### 4.1.2 Factors Determining the Shape of Global Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "The overwhelming bulk of differences in prosperity levels both between countries and across large spans of time are the result of differences in economies’ productive potentials.We classify the most important factors that generate differences in economies’ productive potentials into two broad groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, differences in the economy’s efficiency of labor—how technology is deployed and how organization is used to increase the amount of output a worker can produce with the same amount of capital and other resources. As noted above, these differences are primarily the result of differences in three factors:\n",
    "    * The community of engineering practice\n",
    "    * The skills of workers\n",
    "    * The incentives and efficiency of organizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, differences in how large a multiple of current production has been set aside in the form of useful machines, buildings, and infrastructure to boost the productivity of workers, even with the same technology or organization:\n",
    "    * With differences in natural resources—which are sometimes thought of as separate from and sometimes as a form of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call the first group \"the efficiency of labor\" and the second \"capital intensity\". It has been an important finding by economists over the past three generations that capital and investment have played a substantial role: it is not _all_ increases in knowledge, for increases in thrift and resources have played a substantial role. But it has been an even more important finding that the But an even more important finding is that the lion’s share of economic growth both acroos long spans of time and between countries has come from the factors that affect the efficiency of labor. They are: the advance of knowledge that enables the creation of communities of engineering practice, to diffusion of knowledge and engineering practice, the education and training of workers, and the creation and maintenance of efficient productive organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.2.1 The Efficiency of Labor\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest reason that Americans today are vastly richer and more productive than their predecessors of a century ago is that they have enjoyed an extraordinary ampli  fication of the efficiency of labor. Efficiency has risen for two reasons: advances in technology and in organization. We now know how to make electric motors, dope semiconductors, transmit signals over fiber optics, fly jet airplanes, machine internal combustion engines, build tall and durable structures out of concrete and steel, record entertainment programs on DVDs, make hybrid seeds, fertilize crops with nutrients, organize assembly lines, and do a host of other things our predecessors did not know how to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "These technological advances allow American workers to easily perform value-generating tasks that were unimaginable, or at least extremely difficult to accomplish, a century ago. Moreover, the American economy is equipped to make use of all these technological capabilities. First, we have engineers who understand and can apply modern technologies. There is a very large gap between theoretical knowledge of how the world works and what kinds of things might be possible on the one hand, and actually getting an energy, materials, and machine-based production process working smoothly on the other. An economy that has a large and productive community of engineers with their knowledge and practices will be effective at applying scientific knowledge of how things work and what production processes are conceivable. An economy that does not have such a community of engineering practice does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all the engineering advice and plans turned into blueprints for factory design and manuals for task performance will do no good if the people actually doing the work—the workers—lack the skills and experience to understand and implement them. Education and training are essential components of an economy with a high efficiency of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "And engineers and workers produce little if they are unwilling to work, or if their work is not coordinated. An honest government and a society that rewards productive work—rather than acquisition by fraud or force—is essential. As Adam Smith wrote back in 1776,  The United States today has the forms of business organization, it has the stability and honesty of government, and it has the other socioeconomic institutions needed to successfully utilize modern technology. So it is both better technology and advances in organization that have led to vast increases in the efficiency of labor and thus to American standards of living.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to admit that we economists know less than we should about the processes by which this better technology and these advances in organization come to be. Economists are much better at analyzing the consequences of advances in technology and improvements in organization and other factors that make for a high effi  ciency of labor, but they have less to say about their sources.\n",

Policies that accelerate innovation and diffusion, educate and train workers, improve institutions and so boost the efficiency of labor do the bulk of accelerating economic growth and create prosperity.

    "\n",
    "### 4.2.1 Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.1.1 What Are Economic Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case for all economic models, the Solow growth model consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Variables_: economic quantities of interest that we can calculate and  measure, denoted by letters (or maybe two letters) like L for the number of workers in the labor force or Y for the amount of useful goods and services produced in a year—real GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Behavioral relationships_: relationships that (1) describe how humans, making economic decisions given their opportunities and opportunity costs, decide what to do, and (2) that thus determine the values of the economic variables, represented by equations that have an economic variable on the left hand side and, on the right, a set of factors that determine the value of the variable and a rule of thumb for what that value is currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * _Parameters_: determine which out of a broad family of potential behavioral relations describes the behavior of the particular economic scenario at hand; the ability to work algebraically with parameters allows one to perform an enormous number of potential \"what-if?\" calculations very quickly and in a very small space\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Equilibrium conditions_: conditions that tell us when the economy is in a position of balance, when some subset of the variables are \"stable\"—that is, are either constant are changing in simple and predictable ways, usually represented by solutions of some system of the equations that are behavioral relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Accounting identities_: statements about the relationships between variables that are automatically and necessarily true because of the way the variables are defined, represented by equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.1.2 Keys to the Solow Long-Run Growth Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every economic model has a single key principal economic variable at its heart. We will be most interested in that one variable—the one the model is organized around.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Solow growth model, the key variable is labor productivity: useful production per worker, how much the average worker in the economy is able to produce. We calculate output per worker by simply taking the economy’s level of real GDP or output Y, and dividing it by the economy’s labor force L. Real GDP is the estimated annual value of goods and services produced for final sale: that somebody buys them (or, at least, somebody thinks they will be bought) tells us that they are _useful_. The labor force is the number of workers with or actively looking for jobs. Output per worker, Y/L, is a different concept from output per capita, Y/Pop. Y/Pop is the average income that can be spent to benefit the people, received by them or somebody else. Output per worker Y/L is how much in the way of useful goods and services the aveage worker can produce annually. It is a proxy. Thus it is imperfect. But it is useful because it is a simple proxy for how prosperous an economy is considered as a mechanism for making the things people find necessary, convenient, or luxurious.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every economic model economists proceed with their analysis by looking for an equilibrium: a point of balance, a condition of rest, a state of the system toward which the model will converge over time. Economists look for equilibrium for a simple reason: either an economy is at its (or one of its) equilibrium position(s), or it is moving—and probably (or hopefully?) moving rapidly—to an equilibrium position. The Solow growth model is no exception—\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.2.2.1 Determinants of Output per Worker\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider average worker, a worker whose productivity is simply Y/L, the economywide average. This average worker uses the economy’s current level of technology and organization. These are captured by the current value of the efficiency of labor E. This average worker also uses an average share of the economy’s capital stock, which variable we will denote by \"K\". (Why not \"C\"? Because we are reserving \"C\" for spending on consumption goods and services, as we will see later on.). The average worker has K/L worth of capital to amplify his or her productivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to describe how these two—efficiency of labor E and the capital-to-labor ratio K/L—affect the average worker’s productivity Y/L.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we write down a behavioral relationship that tells us how the average worker’s productivity Y/L is related to the efficiency of labor E and the amount of capital K/L at the average worker’s disposal. We give this behavioral relationship a name: the production function. Tell the production function what resources the economy’s average worker has available, and it will tell you how much output the typical worker can produce. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.2.2 Satisfying Rules of Thumb\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Solow Growth Model, we seek a production function that will satisfy two rules of thumb:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A one percent increase in the capital at the disposal of the average worker—a one percent increase in K/L—will carry with it the same proportional increase in the level of labor productivity—of output per worker Y/L—with a factor of proportionality we will call α, a number between 1 and 0 that serves as a gauge of how quickly opportunities to amplify productivity via using more structures and machines are exhausted, and how rapidly diminishing returns set in. (Note that, when we apply the Solow growth model, different economies will have different values of α; the same economy may well have a different value of α at different times; and asking \"what would happen if the value of the factor of proportionality α were different?\" is one of the principal what-if questions and exercises we will want to undertake and analyze.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A one percent increase in how well technology and organization are used to boost the productivity of the average worker—a one percent increase in the _efficiency of labor_, which we will label E—will carry with it a 1 - α percent increase in the level of labor productivity—of output per worker Y/L. This is best thought of as a definition of what we mean by the _efficiency of labor_ E. (And why the same α here as in the first rule of thumb? Because it makes the ultimate equations we will work with in the model simpler, and it is harder to make mistakes when things are simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one and only one algebraic functional form that satisfies these two rule-of-thumb conditions. It is the so-called Cobb-Douglas function:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ \\frac{Y}{L} =  \\left({\\frac{K}{L}}\\right)^α \\left(E\\right)^{(1-α)}  $\n",
    " \n",
    "This gives us our quantitative rule for calculating what the economy’s level of annual output per worker Y/L will be. It will be equal to the capital stock per worker K/L raised to the power of a parameter α, and then multiplied by the current efficiency of labor E itself raised to the power (1—α).\n",

    ">**Graphing the Cobb-Douglas Production Function**: The Cobb-Douglas production function for α = 1/2, E = 1, for capital per worker K/L from 0 to 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2.3 Alternative Forms of the Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The production function has other, equivalent forms. When we are interested in not the level of output per worker but in the total level of output Y in the economy, we simply multiply both the left- and right-hand sides of the equation above by the labor force L to get the total output form of this Cobb-Douglas production function:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ Y = K^α(EL)^{1-α}  $\n",
    "\n",
    "We could—and economists do—work with some other functional form for the production function, or simply leave it abstract as that output per worker Y/L is some function or other of the capital-labor ratio Y/L and the efficiency of labor E:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ \\frac{Y}{L} = F\\left({\\frac{K}{L}}, E\\right)  $\n",
    "\n",
    "This says just that there is a systematic relationship between output per worker Y/L—real GDP divided by the number of workers—and the economy’s available resources: the capital stock per worker K/L and the efficiency of labor E. The pattern of this relationship is prescribed by the form of the function F( ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why then assume the Cobb-Douglas form? Because it incorporates our two conditions above. These conditions, both of them, (a) are very reasonable rules of thumb, and (b) make our calculations much simpler and easier to understand. We can then give quantitative answers to any questions we are asked about the effects of changes in economic policy and the economic environment on economic growth, and those answers will depend solely on (a) how policy and the environment shift the values of K/L and E, and (b) the value of the economy's factor of proportionality α.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2.4 The Orientation-of-Growth Toward Investment Parameter in the Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of α in the Cobb-Douglas production function tells us how rapidly the economic usefulness of additional investment in buildings, machines, and inventories declines as the economy accumulates more and more of them. That is, α measures how fast diminishing returns to investment set in in the economy. A value of α near zero means that the extra amount of output made possible by an additional unit of capital declines very quickly as the capital stock rises. A value of α near 1 means that each additional unit of capital makes possible almost as large an increase in output as the last additional unit. As α varies from a high number near 1 to a low number near 0, the force of diminishing returns to investment gets stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of illustrating this point in algebra is to use a little calculus to calculate the marginal product of capital, the MPK: how much total output increases as a result of a one-unit increase in the capital stock, dY/dK. For the Cobb-Douglas production function:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ MPK = \\frac{dY}{dK} = αK^{α-1}(EL)^{1-α} = α\\left(\\frac{Y}{K}\\right)  $\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the current capital-to-output ratio, the lower is the marginal product of capital. And the lower the parameter α, the lower is the marginal product of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine what the production function looks like for five different values of α—from a low value of 0.15, in which case diminishing returns set in very quickly, to a high value of 0.75, in which case additional capital is very useful in production over a wide domain of values of capital per worker K/L. All five of the alternative production functions are calibrated so that the level of output per worker Y/L is 40 when the capital-labor ratio K/L is 200. Take away from this graph the flexibility of the Cobb-Douglas production function. It can be used to analyze economies in which the profits from investment and the boost to labor productivity from increasing the capital stock is high. It can be used to analyze economies in which the profits from investment and the boost to labor productivity from increasing the capital stock is low. It can be used to analyze economies in which the profits from investment and the boost to labor productivity from increasing the capital stock is intermediate.\n",

    "The value of E in the Cobb-Douglas production function tells us how good the levels of technology invented and diffused, of worker skills acquired through education and training and experience, and of organizational efficiency both public and private are. That is, E measures the scale of the economy's underlying efficiency and powre. A value of E near zero means that the economy is not very productive at all. A high value of E means that the economy is very productive indeed. Figure 4.2.3 shows what the production function looks like for five different values E, in all cases keeping the diminishing-returns parameter α equal to 1/2.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus the Cobb-Douglas production function is a flexible one, and, indeed, its flexibility is what makes it useful. It can be “tuned” to fit any of a wide variety of different economic situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Are we studying an economy in which productivity is high? Use the Cobb-Douglas production function with a high value of the efficiency of labor E. The value of the efficiency of labor E tells us how high the production function rises: A higher level of E means that more output per worker is produced for each possible value of the capital stock per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the economy rapidly hit the wall as investment proceeds, with little increase in the level of production? Use the Cobb-Douglas function with a low value—near zero—of α. Is the speed with which diminishing returns to investment set in moderate? Pick a middle value of α. The Cobb-Douglas function will once again fit. The value of α determines how quickly the Cobb-Douglas production function flattens out when output per worker is plotted on the vertical axis and capital per worker is plotted on the horizontal axis.\n",

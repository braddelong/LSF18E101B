    "**Capital intensity**: The ratio of the capital stock to total potential output, K/Y, which describes the extent to which capital, as opposed to labor, is used to produce goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divergence**: The tendency for a per capita measurement such as income or standard of living in various countries to become less equal over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demographic transition**: A period in history which sees first a rise and then a fall in birth rates and a sharp fall in death rates as material standards of living increase above \"subsistence\" levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency of labor**: The skills and education of the labor force, the ability of the labor force to handle modern technologies, and the efficiency with which the economy's businesses and markets function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industrial Revolution**: The transformation of the British economy between 1750 and 1850 when, due to technological advances, largely handmade production was replaced by machine-made production.\n",

    "**Long-run economic growth**: The process by which productivity, living standards, and output increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Malthusian age**:\n",
    "A period in which natural-resource scarcity limits any gains from increases in technology; a larger population becomes poor and malnourished, lowering their standard of living, and ultimately lowering population growth to near zero.\n",

    "**Productivity growth**: The rate at which the economy's full-employment productivity expands from year to year as technology advances, as human capital increases, and as investment increases the economy's physical capital stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Productivity growth slowdown**: The period from 1973 to about 1995 when the rate of productivity growth in the United States and other economies suddenly slowed, for still mysterious reasons.\n",
